       <h2> Psalm 84</h2> 

       
       <p class="main" align="left">


I have read this Psalm mentioned below a number of times and each time 
it reveals to me in a fresh way the magnificence and the incredible aura
 of our Almighty God.
<br> <br>
I just cannot help it, for I need to read these verses constantly. I 
would like to memorise these verses so they become a form of prayer. 
They bring healing and a supernatural peace to my soul!
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Psalm 84:1-2</b> 
<br> 1)  How lovely is your dwelling place, 
<br> O LORD Almighty! 
<br> 2) My soul yearns, even faints, 
<br> for the courts of the LORD ; 
<br> my heart and my flesh cry out 
<br> for the living God. </font>
<br> <br>
There is no other exciting, thrilling and wonderful place to be than to be near the Presence of God.
<br> <br>
One can sense how the three disciples felt when they saw the aura and the magnificence of our Almighty God.
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Matthew 17:1-3 The Transfiguration</b> 
<br> After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the 
brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 2) 
There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and 
his clothes became as white as the light.
<br> 3)  Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
<br> <font style="color:#4169E1">
4)  Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you 
wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one 
for Elijah." 
</font> <br>
5)  While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a 
voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am 
well pleased. Listen to him!"
</font>
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Psalm 42:1-2</b> 
<br> 1 As the deer pants for streams of water, 
so my soul pants for you, O God. 
<br> 2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. 
When can I go and meet with God?
</font>
<br> <br>
The hunger to get to know our Lord must be strong. I remember once 
sitting quietly in the local church in London, England, on 3rd April 
1993 and my mind was distracted in wanting to follow my own ambitions 
and desires. I sensed the voice of Our Heavenly Father ministering to me
 and instructing me, “Why don’t you, Anton, pursue my Son and pursue Him
 intensely?"
<br> <br>
From that day on I decided to pursue this instruction meticulously. I 
came back home and took every single banking text book I owned and all 
paraphernalia relating to my potential successful career. I placed them 
neatly in a black garbage bag and threw them away. From then henceforth 
my challenging spiritual journey commenced.
<br> <br>
I sometimes ask myself what did the apostle Paul mean to say or express in this verse : 1 Corinthians 9
verse 24) Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? <br>
 Run in such a way as to get the prize. 25) Everyone who competes in the
 games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will 
not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 26) 
Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight 
like a boxer beating the air. <br> <b> 27) No, I strike a blow to my 
body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I 
myself will not be disqualified for the prize.</b>
<br> <br>

Discern, pray and then hearken.</b></a> 
<br> <br>.</b> 
On 19th December 2015 on page 14, The Nanban Newspaper in Malaysia, published a long article about B. P. Nicholas.
<br> <br>
He was the first Malayan Indian founder of a licensed bank in Malaysia. Please do have a read of it. 
<br> <br>
On 14th April 2015 in the UK, Saida visually saw a prophetic vision of 
an intensely bright light encircling Anton's Dad, Albert, drawing him 
into Heaven. Anton’s Dad in Malaysia aged 99 years old had moved to our 
Lord’s Presence the day before - 13th April 2015. On 26th July 2015 
Anton for the first time called a public meeting in Kuala Lumpur 
Malaysia to honour his Dad's legacy. Without much advertising a group of
 people turned up at the Ball Room, Ascott Central Kuala Lumpur. Watch 
the video to observe how much his late Dad would have loved his son 
speaking so passionately.
