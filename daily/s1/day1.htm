            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Luke 22:7-13</b></span><br>
                7) Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 8) Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."<br>
                9) "Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.<br>
                10) He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, 11) and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' 12) He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."<br>
                13) They left and found things just as Jesus had told them<br><br>
                I just love verse 13 -- Just as Jesus said - it came to pass. Glory be to God!<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Isaiah Chapter 55 verse 11:</b></span><br>
                “so is my word that goes out from my mouth:<br>It will not return to me empty,<br>but will accomplish what I desire<br>and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.”<br><br>
                Alongside verse 13, read the powerful verse of<br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>John Chapter 2 verse 5:</b></span> His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you,"<br>
                for if you hearken a miracle happens, if you do not, you miss out on a real manifestation of the Presence of God moving on your life.<br><br>
                Obedience always brings forth a blessing and the blessing is interposed with incredible peace. This peace will always remind us of God The Holy Ghost, The Comforter: this will give Him the opportunity to pray in and through us what He desires. Then it is no longer us praying, but God The Holy Spirit praying through us. Oh Thank you Heavenly Father!<br><br>
                <b>I desire, God The Holy Ghost praying through me daily!</b><br><br>
                For one day, in August 1999 I heard The Holy Ghost whispering to me, to go and buy a property, This word came to me the same time my business partner lost a lucrative contract. The Word of God sounded louder and mightier than my loss of business. I hearkened in 1999 and when in 2002 I sold the property I recouped back all that I lost in the business contract. Thank you Jesus.<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Psalm 95</b></span><br>
                6) Come, let us bow down in worship,<br>let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;<br>7) for he is our God<br>and we are the people of his pasture,<br>the flock under his care.<br>Today, if you hear his voice,<br>8) do not harden your hearts,<br><br>

                Maybe now is the time to mention about the first book to be written by yours truly P. V. Anton Nicholas. The title is, “The Closeted Thoughts of a Son of a Banker”. This is in memory of my grandfather B. P. Nicholas one of the original founders of a Bank in British Colonial Malaya. The blurb is (just a minor plug) that the author lived in the first floor above the Bank house for more than 21 years. He witnessed at close hand all the financial intricacies and how closely involved the family was in the running of the bank. He will be relating stories that will portray a rainbow of emotions ranging from acute sadness to ecstatic joy!<br><br>
                Leaving aside that we had to maintain a 24 hour security surveillance on the Bank house you will find out what a major role my dear mother, Jeyamani Theresa Nicholas played in the running of the bank. For behind the scene she was like a Brigadier General conducting events. It was done so subtly and meticulously that not many people knew except the close family. There will be some revelatory paragraphs regarding my mother’s deep impacting influence which shaped my life. This actually led to a website being created—the mission statement is to encourage, exhort and how to overcome life’s hurdles and obstacles. To date it has received more than ½ million hits, 559,073 hits from all over the world and it has been visited by 60,035 unique site visitors.<br><br>
                The ethnic Ceylonese Diaspora abiding all over the world most notably in the United Kingdom, (Toronto) Canada, (Sydney+ Perth) Australia, the Middle East, Malaysia, Singapore and of course Jaffna, Sri Lanka will find this book stimulating as well as giving credence and a moral booster to our scattered kindred all over the globe. For some of the individuals mentioned in the book will make splendid role models for the young Ceylonese community notwithstanding everyone else who is desperately seeking a vision.<br><br>
                We attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London on Saturday, 18th September 2010. With the Pope in attendance, we prayed in unity alongside the other 80,000 congregants for a Holy Ghost outpouring on all Catholic Churches. May this be most especially in the United Kingdom.<br><br>

            <h2>Flag Counter</h2>
            <p>
                The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><i><b>8th January 2014.</b></i></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business. As a result we lost all our treasured statistics.<br>
                We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm. It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth!<br><br>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
