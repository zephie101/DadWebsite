            <h2>The Apostle Paul had an overwhelming love for Jesus</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Philippians 1 verse 8</b></span><br><br>
                God can testify how I long for all of you with the <span class="highlight"><b>affection of Christ Jesus</b></span>.<br><br>
                For God is my witness how I long for and pursue you all with love, in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [Himself]!<br><br>
                He knows how much I love and miss you these days. Sometimes I think I feel as strongly about you as Christ does! (WOW!)<br><br>
                God himself knows how much I want to see you. He knows that I care for you in the same way that Christ Jesus does.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recollect what Our Lord Jesus told the apostle Peter:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Matthew 16:17</b></span><br>
                Then Jesus answered him, Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are you, Simon Bar-Jonah. For flesh and blood [men] have not revealed this to you, but My Father Who is in heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expose the depth of this verse to me Father God!<br><br>
                How does one arrive at the depth of love that the apostle Paul has been possessed and baptised with? Is the answer partially in this verse:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>1 Corinthians 11:1</b></span><br>
                PATTERN YOURSELVES after me [follow my example], as I imitate and follow Christ (the Messiah).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have met some people, (very rare) who live and maintain the standard of Philippians 1 verse 8.<br><br>
                Like a professional sportsman, (especially the champions) I need to practise and practise daily the character life of Jesus. It needs a daily rubbing of the anointing of Jesus on my life. My prayer life must be so intense that I will know and know it for sure that God The Father is taking a great delight and pleasure in my prayers.
            </p>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John’s College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
