            <h2>The Apostle Paul had an overwhelming love for Jesus</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Philippians 1 verse 8</b></span><br><br>
                God can testify how I long for all of you with the <span class="highlight"><b>affection of Christ Jesus</b></span>.<br><br>
                For God is my witness how I long for and pursue you all with love, in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [Himself]!<br><br>
                He knows how much I love and miss you these days. Sometimes I think I feel as strongly about you as Christ does! (WOW!)<br><br>
                God himself knows how much I want to see you. He knows that I care for you in the same way that Christ Jesus does.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recollect what Our Lord Jesus told the apostle Peter:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Matthew 16:17</b></span><br>
                Then Jesus answered him, Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) are you, Simon Bar-Jonah. For flesh and blood [men] have not revealed this to you, but My Father Who is in heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expose the depth of this verse to me Father God!<br><br>
                How does one arrive at the depth of love that the apostle Paul has been possessed and baptised with? Is the answer partially in this verse:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>1 Corinthians 11:1</b></span><br>
                PATTERN YOURSELVES after me [follow my example], as I imitate and follow Christ (the Messiah).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have met some people, (very rare) who live and maintain the standard of Philippians 1 verse 8.<br><br>
                Like a professional sportsman, (especially the champions) I need to practise and practise daily the character life of Jesus. It needs a daily rubbing of the anointing of Jesus on my life. My prayer life must be so intense that I will know and know it for sure that God The Father is taking a great delight and pleasure in my prayers.
            </p>
