                Every day I will wake up early in the morning to embrace His joy and His Presence. Something about His Companionship motivates and encourages me to rise up.
            </p>

                I have read this Psalm mentioned below a number of times and each time it reveals to me in a fresh way the magnificence and the incredible aura of our Almighty God.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just cannot help it, for I need to read these verses constantly. I would like to memorise these verses so they become a form of prayer. They bring healing and a supernatural peace to my soul!
            </p>

                I urge you to practice it and see how it transforms you.

                3) Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.<br>

                The hunger to get to know our Lord must be strong. I remember once sitting quietly in the local church, St. James the Great R.C. Church, Peckham Rye, London, UK on Saturday 3rd April 1993. My mind was distracted in wanting to follow my own ambitions and desires. I sensed the voice of Our Heavenly Father ministering to me and instructing me, "Why don't you, Anton, pursue my Son and pursue Him intensely?"
            </p>
            <p>
                From that day on I decided to pursue this instruction meticulously. I came back home and took every single banking text book I owned and all paraphernalia relating to my potential successful career. I placed them neatly in a black garbage bag and threw them away. From then henceforth my challenging spiritual journey commenced.

                <b>First observation in Reading. Evangelism breakthrough May 2016.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A report of an unprecedented openness to the Gospel in Reading, United Kingdom.<br>
                Over a 1000 people made a commitment to Christ. The Pastor was shocked at what happened on the first night. He has always believed that the Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation. He would not compromise on the Gospel that Jesus died for our sins and the Power of the Blood of the Risen Saviour. This is reminiscent of the powerful teaching of the late Derek Prince. I faithfully listen to Derek Prince teachings.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight key-point">
                <b>Please take note of this 'Glory Call.'</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Pastor Yinka Oyekan first began by telling how he received an unusual call about the vision for a mission in Reading from the General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain, Lynne Green.
            </p>
            <p>
                She had received a vision the night before about a Glory Cloud over the country and she described it as beacons of fire which were about prayer. What she described is a Glory Cloud above the nation and this was hitting Reading first. This was hugely significant to the Pastor but also quite a surprise to him hearing from the head of the Baptist Union!
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also hearing incredible reports of what the Holy Spirit is doing in the Northern part of the United Kingdom. In one particular Church about 60 Iranians have become Christians and they are very involved in the Alpha Course. So the Holy Spirit is indeed stirring.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sometimes ask myself what did the apostle Paul mean to say or express in this verse :
            </p>
            <div class="scripture-reference">
                <b>1 Corinthians 9</b><br>

                Run in such a way as to get the prize.<br>
                25) Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last fore<br>
                26) Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.<br>
                <b>27) No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.</b>

            <p>
                On 19th December 2015 on page 14, The Nanban Newspaper in Malaysia, published a long article about B. P. Nicholas.

                On 14th April 2015 in the UK, Saida visually saw a prophetic vision of an intensely bright light encircling Anton's Dad, Albert, drawing him into Heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anton's Dad in Malaysia aged 99 years old had moved to our Lord's Presence the day before - 13th April 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 26th July 2015 Anton for the first time called a public meeting in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia to honour his Dad’s legacy.<br>
                Without much advertising a group of people turned up at the Ball Room, Ascott Central Kuala Lumpur. Watch the video to observe how much his late Dad would have loved his son speaking so passionately.
