            <h2>The Word of the Lord is a protective Circle</h2>
            <p>On many occasions my eyes seem to be transfixed on certain verses although my objective and vision is to complete a passage or a chapter of the bible daily. My spirit seems to capture some verses and one seems to meditate on them for an incredible long time. Take Psalm 1 for instance :</p>
            <p class="highlight"><b>Psalm 1:1-2</b><br>
            BLESSED (HAPPY, fortunate, prosperous, and enviable) is the man who walks and lives not in the counsel of the ungodly [following their advice, their plans and purposes], nor stands [submissive and inactive] in the path where sinners walk, nor sits down [to relax and rest] where the scornful [and the mockers] gather.<br>
            But his delight and desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Jeremiah 17:7-8<br>
            [Most] blessed is the man who believes in, trusts in, and relies on the Lord, and whose hope and confidence in the Lord is.<br>
            For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its roots by the river; and it shall not see and fear when heat comes; but its leaf shall be green. It shall not be anxious and full of care in the year of drought, nor shall it cease yielding fruit.</p>
            <p>These verses bring to me a tremendous comfort, an assurance what I need to do to win the comforting love of Our Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>Some time ago I was just concentrating and meditating on these verses for such a long time that I forgot my awareness for time and Our Lord showered me with a picture image of what happens when we confess the Word Of The Lord:</p>
            <p>When I read the word of the Lord loudly and prophetically it enters Heaven like sparks of fire, the sparks of fire reaches the throne room in a form of an impenetrable, (ring fenced) circle and this circle encloses me, protects me and overshadows me with the tangible love and compassion of Our Heavenly Father !</p>
