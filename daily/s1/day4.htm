            <h2>The Word of the Lord is a Protective Circle</h2>

            <p>On many occasions my eyes seem to be transfixed on certain verses although my objective and vision is to complete a passage or a chapter of the bible daily.</p>

            <p>My spirit seems to capture some verses and one seems to meditate on them for an incredible long time. Take Psalm 1 for instance:</p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Psalm 1:1-2</b></span><br><br>
                <b>1)</b> BLESSED (HAPPY, fortunate, prosperous, and enviable) is the man who walks and lives not in the counsel of the ungodly [following their advice, their plans and purposes], nor stands [submissive and inactive] in the path where sinners walk, nor sits down [to relax and rest] where the scornful [and the mockers] gather.<br><br>
                <b>2)</b> But his delight and desire are in the law of the Lord, and on His law (the precepts, the instructions, the teachings of God) he habitually meditates (ponders and studies) by day and by night.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Read a parallel scripture:</b></span>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Jeremiah 17:7-8</b></span><br><br>
                <b>7)</b> [Most] blessed is the man who believes in, trusts in, and relies on the Lord, and whose hope and confidence in the Lord is.<br><br>
                <b>8)</b> For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its roots by the river; and it shall not see and fear when heat comes; but its leaf shall be green. It shall not be anxious and full of care in the year of drought, nor shall it cease yielding fruit.
            </p>

            <p>These verses bring to me a tremendous comfort, an assurance what I need to do to win the comforting love of Our Heavenly Father.</p>

            <p>Some time ago I was just concentrating and meditating on these verses for such a long time that I forgot my awareness for time and Our Lord showered me with a picture image of what happens when we confess the <span class="highlight"><b>Word Of The Lord:</b></span></p>

            <p>When I read the word of the Lord loudly and prophetically it enters Heaven like sparks of fire, the sparks of fire reaches the throne room in a form of an impenetrable, (ring fenced) circle and this circle encloses me, protects me and overshadows me with the tangible love and compassion of Our Heavenly Father!</p>

                <img src="../../images/profiles/grad_val.jpg" alt="Paul's graduation ceremony"><br>
                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                <img src="../../images/daily/grandpa.jpg" alt="My Dad Albert A Nicholas"><br>
                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
