            <h2>Holy Spirit, please remember my birthday. May your Dear Name Lord Jesus be exalted.</h2>
            <p>
                As I writing this I am aware it's the month of August and today it's my birthday. Glory Be to God! It's very early in the morning, to be precise 1-05 am. On my birthday I go into a quiet reflection, for it's a day to analyse, reflect and ponder!<br><br> One year nearer to meeting Our Lord.<br><br> I ask myself a question, "What will be His first words to me?"<br><br> I am remembering my past years, especially my spiritual and religious grounding! How did I get to this point of even starting a web page called, Daily Readings. Part of the answer is found in<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><i>2 Timothy 1:5-6,14<br>
                I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, <br><br>
                Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</i></span><br><br>

                The above picture is of the Church where my dear Mum and I attended daily services, at Our Lady of Lourdes Klang: No. 114, Jalan Tengku Kelana, 41000, Klang, Selangor, Malaysia. I received much spiritual nurturing within this premises. Our whole family worshipped there on Sunday mornings.
                Mum ingrained in me to attend daily Mass, which I believe started at an early age of seven. I was a daily communicant, attended Saturday Novenas, and also Stations of the Cross. There was also a grotto at the Klang Church that resembled Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto in France which is located on the south-western part of the Hautes-Pyrenees. <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/oriental.htm"> Years later read what happened to me</a> when I was sitting quietly at a church in London, England: St James the Great Church, Peckham Rye, London.<br><br>
                News of heaven’s visitation has come following the miraculous imprinting of the image of the Virgin Mary on a window plane in Subang Jaya, Kuala Lumpur. It appeared on 11th November, 2012. This image has now found a permanent home at the back of Our Lady of Lourdes Klang. This happens to be my former kindergarten which I attended. It has now become a chapel for the image of our Lady of Subang Jaya to rest in and for the world to view.<br><br>
                View this below video of  Heaven's visitation I received when I spent a whole night prayer intercessory vigil at Our Lady of Lourdes grotto in France. You need to view to catch the vision. It all came to pass on 23rd April 1983. It's a fascinating view.<br><br>

                <br><br>
                The faith was rooted and grounded by my dear mum in Malaysia. I was brought up as a devout and faithful Roman Catholic. As a young child I attended Mass at 6 am on a consistent basis. Even till today I can still remember the church bells at the Marian Church of Our Lady of Lourdes Klang chiming loudly.I was so concerned that the bells were disturbing people from sleeping, but for me the bells were informing me that Mass was about to commence. Praying on my knees became a habitual pattern. I developed a relationship with my Heavenly Father at a very young age. I remember an incident that happened to me when I was about 10 to 11 years old. About three to four horrible thieves tried to enter my Dad's bank on the ground floor, as a family we were living on the first floor. My mother woke us all up (this happened between 3-4 am) and we had to keep a watch from the window of the first floor. It was a terrifying experience, knowing there was some foul men right at the bottom of our window. It was such a shocking experience that we forgot the emergency police number, which is 999. The reason why my mother got up was, (which was an act of the Holy Ghost) my mother heard the flutter of our neighbours pigeon wings flying away. Obviously they were disturbed by some intruders. The final story to this was the thieves obviously knew we were up, so they made a grand escape out of the back door.<br><br>
                The next day I was still shaken by this experience. I remember going to the local church and kneeling near the altar, and I was the only one in the church and telling my Heavenly Father that I will serve him for the rest of my life, provided he keeps all thieves and crooks out of our bank house. He was faithful for evermore. No one dared to enter our house!<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><i>Psalm 91: 9 - 11<br>
                If you make the Most High your dwelling- 
                even the LORD, who is my refuge- 
                then no harm will befall you, 
                no disaster will come near your tent. 
                 For he will command his angels concerning you 
                to guard you in all your ways; </i></span><br><br>
                 
                After I prayed and dedicated my prayer to our Lord a few incidents happened.
                Here are a couple of stories.
                During the 1960's large amounts of cash were physically transferred by bank employees from one bank to another bank. For example one of our bank staff used to carry hordes of cash with him to purchase a bank draft from another bank. The other banks were usually British banks and they used to be referred to as the clearing banks.<br><br> Nowadays banks use the facilities of armour plated security vans to transfer cash.
                <br><br>
                On one occasion our third bank clerk Lingam (Arasalingam) was transferring some large cash when he was attacked. This time he was cycling to go to the branch of the Overseas Chinese Bank. One must note here that all these bank branches were not too far away from my Dad's Bank - The Oriental Bank of Malaya Ltd. By bicycle it would just take 5 minutes. My Dad totally trusted all these bank clerks who were transferring the money. Four robbers tried to rough up Lingam but he resisted with all his might and valour and he was slightly injured. The robbers were concerned that Lingam was shouting very loudly and they ran away. I remember coming back from school, La Salle Klang, and my Dad asked me to go to the Police Station to see how badly injured Lingam was.<br><br> When I arrived at the Police Station I was taken into the office of the OCPD ( The Officer in Charge of the Police District) and in a thorough Malaysian lingo he asked me, "What la, your Dad should have employed an Armed Security Van Carrier to transfer hordes of cash around" I obligingly said, "Yes, he should have!"<br><br>
                 Sometimes some of these bank clerks were transferring money to different branches amounting as much as $30,000-00 a day to be placed in the Saving Deposits. One of our clerks use to stash the cash in his underclothing- impenetrable for robbers to reach!!!!<br><br>
                <b>Just suffice to state that Arasalingam was handsomely rewarded a sum of money by my Dad for saving thousands of Malaysian Dollars from falling into the hands of robbers.</b>
                <br><br>
                On another occasion a man came to our bank and he asked to see my Dad. Apparently my Dad knew this man as an acquaintance. He told my Dad that he had won a prize on his lottery ticket. This was during the days when you could go into a bank and redeem your winning price- sometimes this could be thousands and thousands of dollars. My Dad had a thorough look at the lottery ticket and he observed at once that the ticket was fraudulent. When the man found out that my Dad knew, he pleaded with my Dad not to call the Police, for he knew a prison term awaited him. My dad decided to show compassion to him and he destroyed the lottery ticket in his presence. He dumped it in the bin. My mother the intercessor who for all intents and purposes was to our family the unpaid 'assistant bank manager' advised my Dad to pick up the torn lottery ticket and tape it back with some sello tape. Thank God for mum. For the next day the same man came to the bank with a Police Officer and accused my Dad for knowingly destroying a genuine lottery ticket and depriving him of his winnings. My Dad instantly took out the fraudulent ticket and handed it to the policeman. The cheating man was so shocked to see my Dad producing this taped up ticket. The same Policeman took the fraud back to the police station for further questioning. Till to date I do not know what ever happened to the man. All I can say is my mum saved my dad from various untoward incidences.

                The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><i><b>8th January 2014.</b></i></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business. As a result we lost all our treasured statistics.<br><br>
                We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm. It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth!<br><br>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
