            <h2>Be rigidly focused on Jesus Christ!</h2>
            <p>
                I seem to be repeating or what someone will term as regurgitating this blessed phrase today, “Anton, sing the High Praises of the Lord continuously.”<br>
                As one sings loudly or proclaims the high praises, confesses, declares and decrees aloud ----- this spiritual act will automatically commence a process into motion that will submerge and trample down your thought patterns, ideas, opinions, and your daily fears of what’s going to happen which usually tends to be negative! Please let me share with you a couple of scriptures to illustrate this point :
            </p>
            <span class="highlight"><b><i>2 Chronicles 20</i></b></span>
            <p>
                verse 19 Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and <span class="highlight">praised the LORD , the God of Israel, with very loud voice.</span><br>
                verse 21 After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to <span class="highlight">sing to the LORD and to praise him </span>for the splendour of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: <br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>"Give thanks to the LORD , for his love endures forever."</b></span><br>
                verse 22 <span class="highlight">As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.</span><br>
                verse 25 So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value-more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it. 
            </p>
            <p><b>This is another scriptural illustration:</b></p>
            <span class="highlight"><i>Judges 7:15-22</i></span>
            <p>
                5 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands.<br>
                16 Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.<br>
                17 Watch me, he told them. Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.<br>
                18 When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and <span class="highlight"><b>SHOUT, 'For the LORD and for Gideon'</b></span>.<br>
                19 Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.<br>
                20 The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!<br>
                21 While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.<br>
                22 When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am singing the high praises of our Lord today. I am on victory ground.
                I am meditating on this scripture : as long as I am focused on Jesus Christ of Nazareth I am on safe ground.
            </p>
            <span class="highlight"><i>Matthew 14 verse 30 <b>Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus</b></i></span>
            <p>
                As long as Peter was focused on Jesus he was on safe ground, even if it means walking on the water.<br>

                <img src="../../images/profiles/grad_val.jpg" alt="Paul's graduation ceremony"><br>
                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                <img src="../../images/profiles/grad_jvn.jpg" alt="Jannine being admitted to her BA on 28 June 2012"><br>
                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John’s College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                <img src="../../images/daily/grandpa.jpg" alt="My Dad Albert A Nicholas"><br>
                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
