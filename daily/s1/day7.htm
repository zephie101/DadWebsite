    <td width="100%"><font size="5">In 1985 we went for a visit to Malaysia and 
    this was the first time I took my wife, Saida and our son Paul to visit my 
    family who were residing in Selangor, West Malaysia.<p>The local charismatic 
    Christian groups came to know we were there and they invited us to come for 
    their meetings. During the course of the meeting they called us forward to 
    pray for individual people. We sensed the graciousness of The Holy Ghost by 
    His intense tangible Presence there. For many of them fell under the power 
    of God and they were lying on the floor, just saturated by His Presence. The 
    meeting came to an end and by this time it was getting quite late. The 
    midnight hour was approaching. A very tall man approached us and pleaded 
    with us whether we could help him. He told us he was a graduate from the 
    University of Malaya, (for an ethnic Indian Malaysian to enter the 
    University of Malaya means he must be very bright) and now he is a qualified 
    teacher. He went on to share with us that evil spirits were cruelly 
    bothering him and he had no control over his life, for he became very 
    violent, smashing and making holes in walls with his bare fists.&nbsp; One 
    particular event that troubled him the most was when he manifested a 
    particular type of violence to his dear mother. When Saida heard this she 
    wanted to make a dash to the front door, but thanks be to God , she stayed 
    back and supported me. At the same time as this talk was going on inside the 
    church, the Hindus were passing through in a procession outside the church 
    with their holy chariot leading the procession . There were some young men 
    who were carrying out a ritual what one locally refers to as “kavadi” 
    carriers, whilst under a trance their bodies are pierced with knives, steel 
    rods and various other objects as Penance and sacrifice to their gods .</p>

    <p>For this is where the work of an evangelist begins:</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"></sup><font size="5">We prayed for our Malaysian graduate friend, who was 
    desperate for help and our Lord ministered a Prophetic word to him: We 
    declared to him boldly than within the next couple of weeks he will meet an 
    anointed catholic charismatic priest who will operate under the gifting of 
    The Holy Ghost and he will receive complete deliverance. As prophesied he 
    met the priest and he was graciously delivered. A few years later we met the 
    same man again, he was totally set free of the spirit of violence.</p>
