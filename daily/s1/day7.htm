            <h2>Anton, do the work of an evangelist!</h2>
            <p>
                In 1985 we went for a visit to Malaysia and this was the first time I took my wife, Saida and our son Paul to visit my family who were residing in Selangor, West Malaysia. The local charismatic Christian groups came to know we were there and they invited us to come for their meetings. During the course of the meeting they called us forward to pray for individual people. We sensed the graciousness of The Holy Ghost by His intense tangible Presence there. For many of them fell under the power of God and they were lying on the floor, just saturated by His Presence. The meeting came to an end and by this time it was getting quite late. The midnight hour was approaching. A very tall man approached us and pleaded with us whether we could help him. He told us he was a graduate from the University of Malaya, (for an ethnic Indian Malaysian to enter the University of Malaya means he must be very bright) and now he is a qualified teacher. He went on to share with us that evil spirits were cruelly bothering him and he had no control over his life, for he became very violent, smashing and making holes in walls with his bare fists. One particular event that troubled him the most was when he manifested a particular type of violence to his dear mother. When Saida heard this she wanted to make a dash to the front door, but thanks be to God , she stayed back and supported me. At the time as this talk was going on inside the church, the Hindus were passing through in a procession outside the church with their holy chariot leading the procession . There were some young men who were carrying out a ritual what one locally refers to as ‘kavadi’ carriers, whilst under a trance their bodies are pierced with knives, steel rods and various other objects as Penance and sacrifice to their gods .

                <span class="highlight"><i>2 Timothy 4<br>
                1 I CHARGE [you] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, Who is to judge the living and the dead, and by (in the light of) His coming and His kingdom:<br>
                2 Herald and preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency [stand by, be at hand and ready], whether the opportunity seems to be favourable or unfavourable. [Whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it is welcome or unwelcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong.] And convince them, rebuking and correcting, warning and urging and encouraging them, being unflagging and inexhaustible in patience and teaching.<br>
                5 As for you, be calm and cool and steady, accept and suffer unflinchingly every hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully perform all the duties of your ministry.</i></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                We prayed for our Malaysian graduate friend, who was desperate for help and our Lord ministered a Prophetic word to him: We declared to him boldly than within the next couple of weeks he will meet an anointed catholic charismatic priest who will operate under the gifting of The Holy Ghost and he will receive complete deliverance. As prophesied he met the priest and he was graciously delivered. A few years later we met the same man again, he was totally set free of the spirit of violence.

                <span class="highlight"><i>Mark 16:<br>
                15 And Jesus said to them, Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news (the Gospel) to every creature [of the whole human race].<br>
                16 He who believes [who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] and is baptized will be saved [ from the penalty of eternal death]; but he who does not believe [who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] will be condemned.<br>
                17 And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages;<br>
                18 They will pick up serpents; and [even] if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will get well.</i></span>

            <p>
                <b>Food for thought!</b><br>
                Someone asked an eminent pastor, what advise would he give to a young missionary who was crossing the seas to proclaim the gospel, the pastor prayerfully answered, its not crossing the seas that matters but seeing the cross.

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
