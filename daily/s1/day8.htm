            <h2>We need God the Holy Ghost to speak to us!</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight"><b>John 16:13-14</b></span><br>
                13) But when He, the Spirit of Truth (the Truth-giving Spirit) comes, He will guide you into all the Truth (the whole, full Truth). For He will not speak His own message [on His own authority]; but He will tell whatever He hears [from the Father; He will give the message that has been given to Him], and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [that will happen in the future].<br>
                14) He will honour and glorify Me, because He will take of (receive, draw upon) what is Mine and will reveal (declare, disclose, transmit) it to you.<br><br>
                We desperately and urgently need to have a prayerful intimate relationship with God The Holy Ghost:<br><br>
                a) In order for us to give Him a freewill access into our lives with no impediments,<br>
                b) an open door that will grant Him the freedom to speak to us,<br>
                c) to warn us of possible dangers,<br>
                d) to prepare us regarding events and incidents that are going to take place<br>
                e) when our spirits are overflowing and saturated by His Presence than we become His vessels. He will grant us the privilege and the honour to intercede and supplicate His heartfelt burdens.<br><br>
                Please allow me to give you an example.<br><br>
                On the 29th of November 1996, I was performing my normal ritual of shaving in the morning and I suddenly perceived the voice of The Holy Spirit speaking to me, instructing me to go to a certain hospital for there was a very good friend of ours there, a young mother who would be departing to Heaven soon. Just to confirm this my wife rang the hospital ward where she was and were told to come as soon as possible. By the time we arrived which was around 11 pm she was critical. She was surrounded by her very close family. Thank God, The Holy Ghost gave me an opportunity to kiss my dear friend goodbye while she lay unconscious. ( There is a photograph of her below). I was then prompted of the Lord to read a scripture to her and I had to do it there and then. I asked her parents their permission, they consented and I read Psalm 27 aloud and everybody present heard it. In the early hours of the morning our dear friend died.<br><br>
                Weeks later we were informed that when she was conscious, she expressed a fear of dying. She requested Psalm 27 to be read aloud to her to comfort her. I did not know anything about this incident but God The Holy Ghost did. (We now know that for people who are in a coma the sense of hearing is the last to go, so it's heartening to know that our dear friend heard the gracious word of the Lord.)<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Psalm 27</b></span><br>
                1) THE LORD is my Light and my Salvation--whom shall I fear or dread? The Lord is the Refuge and Stronghold of my life--of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
                2) When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.<br>
                3) Though a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, [even then] in this will I be confident.<br><br>
                Our precious late friend is wearing a stripped blouse and we are in deep conversation with her. She will always have a treasured place in our hearts.

                Anton led a well-attended early morning prayer meeting for about two years in the upstairs chambers at St. Marks Church Kennington, London, with an emphasis on united prayer. Listen to one here.<br><br>
                Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity… for there the Lord commanded the blessing – life evermore! The format was the Lord’s Prayer.

                A Prophetic Word for 2016.<br><br>
                Anton delivered a eulogy at his Dad's farewell service, 18th April 2015, in Klang, Selangor, West Malaysia.<br><br>
                Meditate on these scriptures for 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under a strict Vatican ruling the eulogy should not have lasted longer than five minutes under the Pastoral guidance of the local Parish Priest. Thank God the former Bishop of Penang was kind to him. Anton spoke for more than thirteen minutes. He broke all conventions! Hear the eulogy on this video and find out why he spoke under such a burden. Within the talk he sensed and spoke a prophetic word for the year 2016: Please surrender your life totally to Christ Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The solemn words of our Lord Jesus to you:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight"><b>Revelations Chapter 3 verse 20</b></span>:<br>
                'I am now standing at the door and am knocking. If any one listens to My voice and opens the door, I will go in to be with him and will feast with him, and he shall feast with Me.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can view Anton's eulogy to his dad below. View the tribute on the video. See why Anton spoke with such intense passion. You will catch the sincerity of how much our Mum and Dad meant for the Nicholas family. Tears were shed. How could they not be!

                There was a man who was unable to cope with his grief and with a large frown stood to his feet,<br>
                <a href="../s6/day52.htm">right in the midst of an on-going service in front of the grieving audience and shouted 'Then where was your God when this happened?'</a>

            <h2>Flag Counter</h2>
            <p>
                The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><i><b>8th January 2014.</b></i></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business. As a result we lost all our treasured statistics.<br>
                We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm. It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth!<br><br>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
