For He will not speak His own message [on His own authority]; but He will tell whatever He hears [from the Father; He will give the message that has been given to Him], <b> and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [that will happen in the future].

   We desperately and urgently need to have a prayerful intimate 
    relationship with God The Holy Ghost:
    <br> <br>
    a) In order for us to give Him a freewill access into our lives with no 
    impediments,
    <br> <br>
    b) an open door that will grant Him the freedom to speak to us,
    <br> <br>
    c) to warn us of possible dangers,
    <br> <br>
    d) to prepare us regarding events and incidents that are going to take 
    place
    <br> <br>
    e) when our spirits are overflowing and saturated by His Presence than we 
    become His vessels. He will grant us the privilege and the honour to 
    intercede and supplicate His heartfelt burdens.

<br> <br>
n the 29<sup>th</sup> of November 1996, I was performing my normal 
    ritual of shaving in the morning and I suddenly perceived the voice of The 
    Holy Spirit speaking to me, instructing me to go to a certain hospital for 
    there was a very good friend of ours there, a young mother who would be 
    departing to Heaven soon. Just to confirm this my wife rang the 
    hospital ward where she was and were told to come as soon as possible. By 
    the time we arrived which was around 11 pm she was critical. She was surrounded by her very close family. Thank 
    God, The Holy Ghost gave me an opportunity to kiss my dear friend goodbye 
    while she lay unconscious.( There is a photograph of her below). I was then prompted of the 
    Lord to read a scripture to her and I had to do it there and then. I asked her parents their 
    permission, they consented and <b>
    I read <u>Psalm 27</u> </b> aloud and everybody 
    present heard it. In the early hours of the morning our dear friend died.
    <br> <br>
    Weeks later we were informed that when she was conscious, she 
    expressed a fear of dying. She requested <b>Psalm 27 </b>to be read aloud to her to comfort her. I did not know 
    anything about this incident but God The Holy Ghost did. (We now know that
    for people who are in a coma the sense of hearing 
    is the last to go, so it's heartening to know that our dear friend heard the 
    gracious word of the Lord.)

		A Psalm] of David.<br>
		
   1) THE LORD is my Light and my Salvation--whom shall I fear or 
    dread? The Lord is the Refuge and Stronghold of my life--of whom shall I be 
    afraid?<br>
    2) When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to 
    eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.<br>
    3) Though a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; 
    though war arise against me, [even then] in this will I be confident. </FONT>

Anton  led a well-attended early morning prayer meeting for about two years in the upstairs chambers at St. Marks Church Kennington, London, with an emphasis on united prayer.

 A Prophetic Word for 2016. </h3>
 <br> <br> Anton delivered a eulogy at his Dad's farewell service, 18th April 2015,in Klang, Selangor,West Malaysia. 
<br> Meditate on these scriptures for 2016 <br> 
	<br>
<font style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
<p class="main">
Under a strict Vatican ruling the eulogy should not have lasted longer than five minutes under the Pastoral guidance of the local Parish Priest. Thank God the former Bishop of Penang was kind to him. Anton spoke for more than thirteen minutes. He broke all conventions! Hear the eulogy on this video and find out why he spoke under such a burden. Within the talk he sensed and spoke a prophetic word for the year 2016: Please surrender your life totally to Christ Jesus.<br>

<b> The solemn words of our Lord Jesus to you: <br>
Revelations Chapter 3 verse 20:<br> </b>
 'I am now standing at the door and am knocking. If any one listens to My voice and opens the door, I will go in to be with him and will feast with him, and he shall feast with Me.
<br> <br>

<b>You can view Anton's eulogy to his dad below.View the tribute on the video.See why Anton spoke with such intense passion. You will catch the sincerity of how much our Mum and Dad meant for the Nicholas family. Tears were shed. How could they not be!</b> <br>
