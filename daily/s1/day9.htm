		I must constantly remind myself of these above two scriptures, that God The Father has assigned to each believer special angels. This great act of God The Father, speaks to me about the wonderful compassionate and caring character of my Divine Heavenly Father.
<br> <br>
Its good to note that the word Angel, Angels and Archangels are mentioned about 300 times in the bible.

<h2> An example of angelic manifestation </h2>
<p class="main"> <br> <br>
In June 1978, my friend Damien and I attended an International Charismatic conference at the RDS stadium in Dublin, the capital of the Republic of Ireland. One evening when the meeting ended we left with the other 23,000 participants to head into town to catch a bus. We needed to catch a particular bus to reach the home where we were residing in for the course of the whole week.
<br> <br>
We were both aware that we were in the company of such a large gathering, that some of them might want to catch the same bus that we were heading for. This day we were extremely exhausted! My friend Damien came out with a preposterous idea that he is going to place his hand out and appeal to a car to stop in this busy roadway, so that the car can take us to the bus stop in the city as quickly as possible. I must admit my faith was not strong that day, but thank God for Damien's faith. For I was shocked that a car actually stopped and it was a lady driver. Just before we reached our destination my curiosity got the better part of me and I needed an answer to this question. I asked the lady driver directly but politely , why did she stop the car for two strangers. She responded by staying, "you are two priests, are you not?" We replied that we were not priests. She said ," the only reason why I stopped the car was that I saw two priests wearing white cassocks standing on the road and I decided to give these two priests a lift." She than looked at us aghast and she noticed we were not wearing  white cassocks. She spontaneously told us that if she did not see us as priests, she definitely would not have stopped the car. We than realised that she actually saw with her own eyes our angels standing beside us. This is an awesome thought!!

We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm.It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth! <font style="background-color:#FFFFCC"><b> Statistics commenced 8th January 2014.</b>

        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from 
        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is 
        pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family 
        member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left. 
		<p class="side">
        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 
        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 
        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.
        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>
        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.
        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> The conditions are steep for Jannine </b> </a>
         she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
