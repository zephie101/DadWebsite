            <p><span class="highlight"><b>Psalm 20:1-2</b></span><br>
            May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high [and defend you];<br>
            Send you help from the sanctuary and support, refresh, and strengthen you from Zion.</p>
            <p>Oh! I need to tell you how the above verses saved me from an uncalled for disaster one day. Before this incident took place, I must state that I confessed these above mentioned verses everyday. To me it was like a sealed contract between God the Father and myself. For I see the Word of God as ‘alive’, as stated in Hebrews 4 verse 12:</p>
            <p class="highlight">For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [making it active, operative, energizing, and effective]; it is sharper than any two-edged sword.</p>
            <p>We were doing our normal school run, going to pick up our daughter Jannine from school. As we did this route five days a week, it became a very familiar territory— so we were aware of every nook and corner of the route. As we took a short cut, we needed to take a right turn from a side road on to the main road. This main road can be particularly busy on a school day, owing to the fact there were two major schools on this same road. Most of the residents who live on this road park their cars alongside the road, this thereby causes a blind spot, if one turns right. As I drove out slowly to turn right , I needed to move into a position where I could see the traffic coming along. I observed a motorcyclist coming towards me and I immediately pressed my brakes to stop my car. The motorcyclist took offence at my action and he motioned his hand towards me asking of me whether I was blind. I looked shocked at his reaction and requested of him to move on so that I could cross the road. He immediately metamorphosed into a monster and he completely turned around his motorbike and was heading towards my direction. I have heard and read enough horror and tragic stories about road rages to know what was going to happen next -- one thing I had already gathered was that this monster was not going to reason with me. Spontaneously the above verses were coming forth, like an overflow, from my spirit:</p>
            <p class="highlight"><b>My version of Psalm 20 :</b><br>
            Verse 1 ) <b>MAY THE Lord answer Anton in the day of trouble! </b>May the name of the God of Jacob set Anton up on high [and defend me];<br>
            Verse 2) Please, please send me help from the sanctuary and support me, Father!</p>
            <p>As I uttered these verses to my dear Heavenly Father, it suddenly began to drizzle. He was heading towards my direction and the motorcycle slipped and he lost control. He fell down on to the road. He got up, and we both looked at each other, and he was trying to make an attempt to come towards me, but I really believe a Holy Presence was stopping him. This time he looked shocked and bewildered at what had taken place. I observed that he was physically all right. I then proceeded to pick up our daughter.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight"><b>I am constantly thanking God for being a real Father to me!</b></span></p>
            <p>The lesson from this above testimony is, please do not leave home without uttering a prayer of safety and security. Most especially during these days of darkness.<br>
            For the enemy is an opportunist, waiting surreptitiously to disarm us. Our foes manifest in different shapes and forms. His aim is to disturb our peace, harmony and security with our Lord Jesus.<br>
            Remember Our Lord Jesus is Jehovah Shalom: Nothing missing and nothing broken.<br>
            In Hebrew the word SHALOM is peace: which literally means wholeness, conjoined with safety, peace, prosperity etc. <br>
            Bless the Lord Shalom can also mean, 'undisturbed composure. (Absence of agitation or discord, to be complete, perfect and full.)'</p>
