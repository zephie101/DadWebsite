<h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the You Tube video below.</h2> 
		<p class="main">On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
		 Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
		 In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
    “Lead Kindly Light”.

<b> 
Proverbs 11:30 </b> 
<br>
    Two translations of the same verse
<br><br><FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise</FONT>
<br><br><FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
The fruit of the [uncompromisingly] righteous is a tree of life, and he who is wise captures human lives [for God, as a fisher of men — he gathers and receives them for eternity].</FONT>
<br><br>
The first part of the verse of <b>2 Timothy 4:2</b> is cemented permanently as a firm foundation in my spirit: <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">“Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season;”</FONT>
<br> <br>
In January 1979 I received an instruction from our Lord to return back to the United Kingdom. A few days before my departure I was feeling very restless and uneasy. From my previous experiences I knew the only way I could regain back my peace was to go on my knees. Thank God our Heavenly Father has given us the key: always pray and pray for peace to be reinstated.   
<br><br>
<b> Psalm 85:8 </b>  <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> I will listen to what God will say; he promises peace to his people,</FONT>
<br><br>
Whilst I was on my knees I realised what He was telling me to do to shake off my restlessness. An image of a lady came to my mind .He was requesting me to invite this lady to come for a prayer meeting in my hometown, in Klang, Malaysia, before I depart for England.
<br><br>
The problem was, I had only met this lady once when I visited her house with my parents. It was a Public holiday, the Hindus in Malaysia were celebrating the festival of “deepavali” It was on this occasion that I heard the history of this lady. She came from a Catholic background and she married a man of a Hindu faith. One new year’s eve after attending a party, he was driving back home and was involved in a serious accident and very sadly he died. I believe she had three children to take care of. It was this lady that our Lord was prompting me to invite for a prayer meeting. I asked my parents to help me but they coaxed me to approach her directly. With fear and trepidation I did so. I told her my charismatic prayer group was having a party that week and whether she would like to come . Her response was that if she was free, she would come. I responded by saying I will bring my car and give her a lift. When the day came, I felt it was going to be a negative response. I arrived at her house and she was not ready. She apologised that she was not able to come. I told her I came on a Lord’s mandate and I had to follow His instruction to invite her for the meeting. There was an incredible change in the spiritual atmosphere and she suddenly changed her mind and she said she would come.
<br><br>
When I brought her in to the prayer meeting, the people gathered there were in a state of shock, as to who I was bringing in. For this lady was a beauty queen, for she had taken part in some national competitions and she was stunningly beautiful. All they were concerned about was, how I managed to bring this beauty queen for the prayer meeting. In the end it was left to me to talk to her about salvation in Christ Jesus. When I dropped her back home, I had to impart to her, the Word of the Lord. I told her I did not know when I would see her again, for I was leaving in three days time, but please, please to remember this that if she ever faced a serious crisis or was confronted by a circumstance that she could not control , than she should immediately call on the name of Our Lord, Jesus and implore Him to have mercy on her. She told me that she would always remember that. I waved her goodbye and left.
<br><br>
A year or so later I received some paper articles from Malaysia. The headlines of The Straits Times of Malaysia and The Malay Mail shockingly read, “A beauty queen has been viciously stabbed to death, the only part of the body they spared was her beautiful face .”
<br><br>
My prayer is, I pray she remembered my final parting words to her, to call upon the name of Our Lord.
<br> <br>
<b>Acts 2:21 </b>
<br>
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
And it shall be that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord [[ invoking, adoring, and worshiping the Lord--Christ] shall be saved. </FONT>

        ( All Saints Church, Peckham) in 1986, I uttered my prayer from the outside of the church, He had it all planned that one day I was going to get up before dawn to go and intercede inside the church!!!  He once declared that HE IS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA.

		<br> <br> On 18th July 2010 as a family we attended the morning service at St. Mary Magdalene with St. Martin’s church, Addiscombe on Canning Road. 
        <b>We heard the newly instituted and inducted Vicar, the Reverend Amanda Johnson presenting her first sermon. The scripture she chose for her introductory sharing was Psalm 23- THE LORD IS (indeed) MY SHEPHERD.

		<br> <br> Our connection to this church is due to the fact that a close member of our family is a faithful attendee and who is very involved with the worship. This compels us to pray.

        <br> <br> Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005.
        Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.
        Our fresh breaking news in 2009 is that Paul will be receiving  his MA from Cambridge, March 2009, and his MSc from Imperial College, London.
        He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.
        His graduation ceremony, for his MSc, will take place in the Royal Albert Hall in May 2009.
        On 17th July 2009 Paul conveyed the thrilling news to us that he had passed his final Actuarial Paper.
        Today 24th July 2009 his name was published in the London Times, page 68 stating he is now a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
        Well done Paul! You can relax now and enjoy your profession as a fully qualified Actuary.
        <br> <br> The further breaking news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.
        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>
        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.
        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).

        what delivered Valerie Meilton of all her painful nasty lumps.
        For when she joined our family she was in harrowing despair.
        <br> <br> On Friday, 16th January 1999, we were in Valerie’s house in Claygate, Surrey.
        At 11-15 pm  we were about to leave for London, we went to say goodnight to Valerie’s Mum Vera Meilton .
        It was during this momentous moment she looked directly at us and told us in a rather sweet indirect fashion, “please take care of my only daughter”.
        The final words she uttered to us were “All you need is Jesus.”
        We than prayed and anointed Vera with Holy oil and dedicated her to the sweet Presence of Jesus. 
        6 days later she died peacefully at Kingston General Hospital, with Valerie holding her hands.
