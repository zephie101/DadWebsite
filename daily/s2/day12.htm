            <h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the YouTube video below.</h2>
            <p>On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London. Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park. In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung, "Lead Kindly Light".</p>

            <h2>The Hymn below, Lead Kindly Light radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</h2>
            <h2>Prayer meetings of this nature are mandatory.</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight"><b>Proverbs 11:30</b></span><br>
            Two translations of the same verse<br><br>
            <span class="highlight">The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise</span><br><br>
            <span class="highlight">The fruit of the [uncompromisingly] righteous is a tree of life, and he who is wise captures human lives [for God, as a fisher of men — he gathers and receives them for eternity].</span><br><br>
            The first part of the verse of <b>2 Timothy 4:2</b> is cemented permanently as a firm foundation in my spirit: <span class="highlight">"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season;"</span><br><br>
            In January 1979 I received an instruction from our Lord to return back to the United Kingdom. A few days before my departure I was feeling very restless and uneasy. From my previous experiences I knew the only way I could regain back my peace was to go on my knees. Thank God our Heavenly Father has given us the key: always pray and pray for peace to be reinstated.<br><br>
            <b>Psalm 85:8</b> <span class="highlight">I will listen to what God will say; he promises peace to his people,</span><br><br>
            Whilst I was on my knees I realised what He was telling me to do to shake off my restlessness. An image of a lady came to my mind. He was requesting me to invite this lady to come for a prayer meeting in my hometown, in Klang, Malaysia, before I depart for England.<br><br>
            The problem was, I had only met this lady once when I visited her house with my parents. It was a Public holiday, the Hindus in Malaysia were celebrating the festival of "deepavali" It was on this occasion that I heard the history of this lady. She came from a Catholic background and she married a man of a Hindu faith. One new year's eve after attending a party, he was driving back home and was involved in a serious accident and very sadly he died. I believe she had three children to take care of. It was this lady that our Lord was prompting me to invite for a prayer meeting. I asked my parents to help me but they coaxed me to approach her directly. With fear and trepidation I did so. I told her my charismatic prayer group was having a party that week and whether she would like to come. Her response was that if she was free, she would come. I responded by saying I will bring my car and give her a lift. When the day came, I felt it was going to be a negative response. I arrived at her house and she was not ready. She apologised that she was not able to come. I told her I came on a Lord's mandate and I had to follow His instruction to invite her for the meeting. There was an incredible change in the spiritual atmosphere and she suddenly changed her mind and she said she would come.<br><br>
            When I brought her in to the prayer meeting, the people gathered there were in a state of shock, as to who I was bringing in. For this lady was a beauty queen, for she had taken part in some national competitions and she was stunningly beautiful. All they were concerned about was, how I managed to bring this beauty queen for the prayer meeting. In the end it was left to me to talk to her about salvation in Christ Jesus. When I dropped her back home, I had to impart to her, the Word of the Lord. I told her I did not know when I would see her again, for I was leaving in three days time, but please, please to remember this that if she ever faced a serious crisis or was confronted by a circumstance that she could not control, than she should immediately call on the name of Our Lord, Jesus and implore Him to have mercy on her. She told me that she would always remember that. I waved her goodbye and left.<br><br>
            A year or so later I received some paper articles from Malaysia. The headlines of The Straits Times of Malaysia and The Malay Mail shockingly read, "A beauty queen has been viciously stabbed to death, the only part of the body they spared was her beautiful face."<br><br>
            My prayer is, I pray she remembered my final parting words to her, to call upon the name of Our Lord.<br><br>
            <b>Acts 2:21</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">And it shall be that whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord [invoking, adoring, and worshiping the Lord--Christ] shall be saved.</span></p>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
