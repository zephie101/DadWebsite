            <p>Our families need to be preserved and protected.<br>
            Video pasted below.<br><br>
            It will help you on how to prepare for the year 2015: It will encourage you on how to be ready. It is compelling viewing of only 6 Minutes.<br><br>
            Luke Chapter 18 verse 8b: "But when the Son of Man (Jesus) returns, how many will He find on the earth who have faith?"<br><br>
            We pray that we will remain steadfast and faithful to the end. Pray that we will be a sweet fragrance to Jesus.</p>

            <h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the YouTube video below.</h2>
            <p>On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London. Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park. In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung, "Lead Kindly Light".</p>

            <h2>The Hymn below, Lead Kindly Light radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</h2>
            <h2>Prayer meetings of this nature are mandatory.</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight"><b>1 Corinthians 2:9</b></span><br>
            However, as it is written: <span class="highlight">"No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him"</span><br><br>
            Let us imagine for a moment that if my parents had told me, Anton your eyes cannot visualise and your ears cannot apprehend and neither can your mind imagine what we, as your parents have planned and going to sacrifice for you, to make sure that your vision, desire and your ambition in life will be fulfilled. My response would be WOW!
            Whenever my spirit needs to be recharged, or to be rejuvenated or revitalised, than I read the above prescriptive verses. It's like medicine to my spirit.<br><br>
            <b>Proverbs 17:22</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</span><br><br>
            Look at what else, God the Father has planned for us through the advocacy of our Dear Friend, God The Holy Ghost!<br><br>
            <b>Philippians 1:3 &amp; 6</b><br>
            I thank my God every time I remember you, ... being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.<br><br>
            What is the vision of The Holy Ghost in my life? The answer is in:<br>
            <b>Galatians 4:19</b><br>
            My little children, for whom I am again suffering birth pangs until Christ is completely and permanently formed (moulded) within you,<br><br>
            This excites me, that daily I am being moulded like Jesus Christ, (the Anointed One), but I am very aware of the following verse:<br>
            <b>Philippians 3:13-14</b><br>
            I do not consider, brethren, that I have captured and made it my own [yet]; but one thing I do [it is my one aspiration]: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the [supreme and heavenly] prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward.<br><br>
            Thank God the task involved in this verse keeps my spirit, soul, body and mind busy and occupied!</p>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
