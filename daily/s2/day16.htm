            Luke Chapter 18 verse 8b: "But when the Son of Man (Jesus) returns, how many will He find on the earth who have faith?"<br><br>
            We pray that we will remain steadfast and faithful to the end. Pray that we will be a sweet fragrance to Jesus.</p>

            <h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the YouTube video below.</h2>
            <p>On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London. Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park. In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung, "Lead Kindly Light".</p>

            <h2>The Hymn below, Lead Kindly Light radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</h2>
            <h2>Prayer meetings of this nature are mandatory.</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight"><b>Revelation 7:9-12</b></span><br>
            <span class="highlight">I looked again. I saw a huge crowd, too huge to count. Everyone was there--all nations and tribes, all races and languages. And they were standing, dressed in white robes and waving palm branches, standing before the Throne and the Lamb and heartily singing: Salvation to our God on his Throne! Salvation to the Lamb!<br>
            All who were standing around the Throne--Angels, Elders, Animals--fell on their faces before the Throne and worshiped God, singing: Oh, Yes! The blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving, The honour and power and strength, To our God forever and ever and ever! Oh, Yes!</span><br><br>
            I have got this understanding that whatever takes place around Heaven's throne, a minute duplicate of this, a replica needs to take place in our churches. So can you imagine how glad and excited I was to read and hear of what's happening in some churches around the world. I read this article in one of the Christian magazines. Apparently in 1984, a pastor by the name of Michael Bickle began to pursue the vision of restoring the tabernacle of David through a 24-hour intercessory prayer, praise and worship. Something tremendous began to happen in his church. For a start they began having 17 prayer meetings a week. Praise the Living God!<br><br>
            Oh! may this vision penetrate nearly every spirit filled church in the whole wide world. Something of the essence and the spirit of Revelation 7 verse 9 &amp; 10 &amp; 11. We have got to maintain an attitude of just naturally flowing into praising and worshiping our Living God. We then move to the higher echelon of adoring Jesus Christ of Nazareth.<br><br>
            <b>Psalm 29</b><br>
            2) Give unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.<br><br>
            As we adore Our Lord on a continuous and lengthy basis we begin to partake of His Presence. For what we worship we become, this means we take on the characteristics of Jesus. We are totally focussed on Him: The Alpha and the Omega. I still cherish those moments, during my student days when I used to go into a chapel in Westminster Cathedral here in London and sit in front of the altar and in silence just adoring Our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth. This enhanced and strengthened my spiritual life tremendously. Sometimes whilst I am driving the car, spontaneously these words come out of my mouth, "Oh! thank you Jesus!" or "thank you Father." and I suddenly realise I am in the presence of other people. The reason being just for a few minutes my mind was totally focused on the Lord.<br><br>
            A strange phenomena occurs to me whenever I am buffeted by anxieties or I am overly concerned by certain circumstances. For me to be free of this oppression, all I need to do is to play a CD or a audio cassette of an anointed Praise and worship song. As I listen attentively to this particular song the oppression suddenly lifts off! I have asked myself what is the component within the singing that reinstates back my peace. The answer is obvious: The song is totally worshiping, adoring, concentrating and centering on our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth and as I adore Him, God The Holy Ghost moves in and supernaturally drives away and eliminates my oppression.<br>
            Alleluia!<br><br>
            <span class="highlight"><b>Psalm 5</b><br>
            In the morning You hear my voice, O Lord; in the morning I prepare [a prayer, a sacrifice] for You and watch and wait [for You to speak to my heart].<br>
            But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love and mercy; I will worship toward and at Your holy temple in reverent fear and awe of You.</span><br><br>
            I just hope one day, God The Holy Ghost will grant me His consent to commence a prayer meeting that will take on just an aspect of Revelation Chapter 7 verse 9 till verse 12.</p>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
