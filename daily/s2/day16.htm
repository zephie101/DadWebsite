<h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the You Tube video below.</h2> 
		<p class="main">On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
		 Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
		 In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
    “Lead Kindly Light”.

<b> Revelation 7:9-12 </b>
<br>
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
I looked again. I saw a huge crowd, too huge to count. Everyone was there--all nations and tribes, all races and languages. And they were standing, dressed in white robes and waving palm branches, standing before the Throne and the Lamb                   
<br>
and heartily singing:
Salvation to our God on his Throne!
Salvation to the Lamb!
<br>
All who were standing around the Throne--Angels, Elders, Animals--fell on their faces before the Throne and worshiped God,
<br>
singing:
Oh, Yes!
The blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving,
The honour and power and strength,
To our God forever and ever and ever!
Oh, Yes! </FONT>
<br><br>
 I have got this understanding that whatever takes place around Heaven’s throne, a minute duplicate of this, a replica needs to take place in our churches. So can you imagine how glad and excited I was to read and hear of what’s happening in some churches around the world. I read this article in one of the Christian magazines. Apparently in 1984, a pastor by the name of Michael Bickle began to pursue the vision of restoring the tabernacle of David through a 24-hour intercessory prayer, praise and worship. Something tremendous began to happen in his church. For a start they began having 17 prayer meetings a week. Praise the Living God !
 <br><br>
Oh! may this vision penetrate nearly every spirit filled church in the whole wide world. Something of the essence and the spirit of Revelation 7 verse 9 & 10 &11.We have got to maintain an attitude of just naturally flowing into praising and worshiping our Living God. We then move to the higher echelon of adoring Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
<br><br>
<b>Psalm 29</b>
<br>
2)   Give unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
<br><br>
As we adore Our Lord on a  continuous and lengthy basis we begin to partake of His Presence. For what we worship we become, this means we take on the characteristics of Jesus. We are totally focussed on Him : The Alpha and the Omega. I still cherish those moments, during my student days when I used to go into a chapel in Westminster Cathedral here in London and sit in front of the altar and in silence just adoring Our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth. This enhanced and strengthened my spiritual life tremendously.
Sometimes whilst I am driving the car, spontaneously these words come out of my mouth, “Oh! thank you Jesus!” or “thank you Father.” and I suddenly realise I am in the presence of other people. The reason being just for a few minutes my mind was totally focused on the Lord.
<br><br>
A strange phenomena occurs to me whenever I am buffeted by anxieties or I am overly concerned by certain circumstances. For me to be free of this oppression, all I need to do is to play a CD or a audio cassette of an anointed Praise and worship song. As I listen attentively to this particular song the oppression suddenly lifts off ! I have asked myself what is the component within the singing that reinstates back my peace. The answer is obvious: The song is totally worshiping, adoring, concentrating and centering on our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth and as I adore Him, God The Holy Ghost moves in and supernaturally drives away and eliminates my oppression.
<br>
Alleluia!
<br><br>
<b>Psalm 5</b>
<br><FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
In the morning You hear my voice, O Lord; in the morning I prepare [a prayer, a sacrifice] for You and watch and wait [for You to speak to my heart].
<br>
But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love and mercy; I will worship toward and at Your holy temple in reverent fear and awe of You.
</FONT>
<br><br>
I just hope one day, God The Holy Ghost will grant me His consent to commence a prayer meeting that will take on just an aspect of Revelation Chapter 7 verse 9 till verse 12.

		<b> Surely Our Lord  knew it from the very Beginning, for His Name implies it.</b>
		<br> <br> He knew that when He first ingrained the burden in me to pray for this church, 
        ( All Saints Church, Peckham) in 1986, I uttered my prayer from the outside of the church, He had it all planned that one day I was going to get up before dawn to go and intercede inside the church!!!  He once declared that HE IS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA.

		<br> <br> On 18th July 2010 as a family we attended the morning service at St. Mary Magdalene with St. Martin’s church, Addiscombe on Canning Road. 
        <b>We heard the newly instituted and inducted Vicar, the Reverend Amanda Johnson presenting her first sermon. The scripture she chose for her introductory sharing was Psalm 23- THE LORD IS (indeed) MY SHEPHERD.
        </b>
		<br> <br> Our connection to this church is due to the fact that a close member of our family is a faithful attendee and who is very involved with the worship. This compels us to pray.
		<br> <br> Amanda you will be remembered in our prayers. May a revival blossom.

        <img class="side" src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/profiles/grad_val.jpg" width="240" height="345" alt="Paul's graduation ceremony">
        <br> <br> Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005.
        Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.
        Our fresh breaking news in 2009 is that Paul will be receiving  his MA from Cambridge, March 2009, and his MSc from Imperial College, London.
        He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.
        His graduation ceremony, for his MSc, will take place in the Royal Albert Hall in May 2009.
        On 17th July 2009 Paul conveyed the thrilling news to us that he had passed his final Actuarial Paper.
        Today 24th July 2009 his name was published in the London Times, page 68 stating he is now a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
        Well done Paul! You can relax now and enjoy your profession as a fully qualified Actuary.
        <br> <br> The further breaking news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.
        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>
        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.
        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).

        what delivered Valerie Meilton of all her painful nasty lumps.
        For when she joined our family she was in harrowing despair.
        <br> <br> On Friday, 16th January 1999, we were in Valerie’s house in Claygate, Surrey.
        At 11-15 pm  we were about to leave for London, we went to say goodnight to Valerie’s Mum Vera Meilton .
        It was during this momentous moment she looked directly at us and told us in a rather sweet indirect fashion, “please take care of my only daughter”.
        The final words she uttered to us were “All you need is Jesus.”
        We than prayed and anointed Vera with Holy oil and dedicated her to the sweet Presence of Jesus. 
        6 days later she died peacefully at Kingston General Hospital, with Valerie holding her hands.
