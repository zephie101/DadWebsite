       <h2> Pray the Holy 
Spirit language at all times.For this is the only language the myriads in the Kingdom of darkness do not comprehend. This unique language is only known to the Blessed Trinity- Father, Son and The Holy Spirit.</h2> 

       
       <p class="main" align="left">
I did not realise how powerful and effective the "Heavenly 
    language" is, until an incredible incident happened to me in Malaysia. The Pentecostals 
    and also the Bible refer to the "Heavenly Language" as speaking in tongues. 
    Although this episode happened in 1978, I still remember it very vividly and 
    this attests to the fact that God The Holy Ghost is an excellent instructor 
    and teacher. Speaking in tongues is an immense spiritual warfare tool 
    especially when you are involved directly in <b>hand to hand combat with demonic 
    forces.</b> <br> <br>
    <font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> 1 Corinthians 14:2</b> 
<br> <i> <u>(You are Speaking unto God.)</U> </i> <br>
<br> For one who speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not to men but to God, for no one understands or catches his meaning, because in the [Holy] Spirit he utters secret truths and hidden things [not obvious to the understanding.
<br> <br>
<b> Acts 10:46</b> 
<br> <i> <u>(Praise and worship God by speaking or singing in Tongues) </U> </i> <br>
<br> For they heard them speaking in tongues[ Or other languages] and praising God.
<br> <br>
<b> 1 Corinthians 14:39</b> 
<br> <i> <u>(Practise speaking in tongues as a habitual pattern) </u> </i> <br>
<br> Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. </font>

It was October 1978 and I was fast asleep at home in Malaysia, which is about 6000 miles from London, England. All of a sudden, between 3am - 3-30 am, I woke up from a deep sleep and I was very troubled. My eyes were than transfixed on this image. It looked like someone had placed the picture of my brother Justin right in front of my eyes. Justin was studying in London. All I could feel at that moment was that his life was in danger. This was a period when there was no such terminology as mobile phones, WhatsApp or anything similar of this nature. I could not contact my brother instantly. There was no Internet whatsoever. <br> <br>
 This is an example of a circumstance when one needs to speak in tongues, for one is totally unaware of what's happening. Only my brother Justin and God The Holy Ghost knew of what was really happening at that particular moment. I awoke from my sleep very quickly and started praying in tongues violently.
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Matthew 11:12</b> 
<br> From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force. </font>

<br> <br>
I ceased praying in tongues only when I sensed in the Holy Ghost that whatever I was praying for had achieved its victorious answer! I did not pursue this matter until I arrived in London in January 1979. I was putting on my winter coat, ( my brother had borrowed this coat to keep himself warm whilst I was away), as I placed my hands inside the pocket I noticed that there was an underground Tube ticket. I took this out and I observed it was an October date. Then it dawned on me that it was the same date that I was woken up from my deep sleep when I was in Malaysia. I felt I had to urgently quiz my brother and ask him what happened on this date. When I questioned him he was very evasive and he was not prepared to give me any answers. I had to explain to him the whole scenario of what happened in Malaysia. Only than he volunteered the information. This was a Friday night, he and some of his friends were walking in the streets in North London and some very violent thugs pounced on them and began to beat and punch them, which was an unprovoked attack. They severely attacked my brother. This was the time, when all this violence was being perpetrated, unknown to me, I was woken up from my sleep in Malaysia, thousands of miles away and  began to pray in tongues violently.
<br> <br>
When my brother was taken to the casualty department in the hospital, the Doctors were amazed and dumbfounded, given the severity of the beating that there was no internal bleeding and there were no fractures in his body and they discharged him. Oh, thank God, The Holy Ghost saved his life.
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Ephesians 6:18</b> 
<br> And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints. </font>

<b>Regarding this below mentioned wedding, intense Praying in the Spirit took place. We had to encounter tremendous Spiritual Warfare. To understand what this means one needs to watch this wedding video closely.<br><br> My Dear sister Geraldine was amazed how intensely I was praying for this wedding to come to pass. For she watched me very closely on the depth of my prayer.</b> <br><br>

<b> This video below is only 3 minutes long. Seriously engage with this very short video clip for in 2021 the forces of hell want to vent and manifest their fury.</b> It has already commenced. It is not a battle between nations, people, religion or ethnicity. It is actually a vicious battle between Kingdoms. It is Kingdom against Kingdom.<br>
 <br> Our families need to be preserved and protected.<br> Video pasted below.<br> <br>It will help you on how to prepare for the year 2021: It will encourage you on how to be ready. It is compelling viewing. Luke Chapter 18 verse 8b: "But when the Son of Man (Jesus) returns, how many will He find on the earth who have faith?"

<u><b> A precious event took place on 28th August 2020.</b> </u> <br> <br>

<b><u>28th August 1995.</b></u> <br> <br>
It was on this day 25 years ago that my Dear Mum Jeyamani Theresa Nicholas was called to Heaven to be with Our Lord Jesus Christ.<br> <br>
My inspiring Mum’s story is on this below mentioned link: Worth a read:<br>

<a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/daily/s2/day14.htm">(<b>Press this link: My Mum was a bastion of faith </b>)</span></a><br> <br>

On 28th August 2020 we were presented with a gift of our first precious grandchild, a granddaughter.<br> <br>
Born at 10-50 pm to our son Paul and our daughter-in - law Gloria at St. Thomas’ Hospital London, UK.
Our granddaughter was determined to be born on this auspicious day. We know for we were kept up to date with the stages of the childbirth.<br> <br>
For 25 years, every year we remembered incredible memories of my Dear Mum. The date 28th August always reminded us of my late Mum.<br> <br>
 On 28th August 2020 our granddaughter comes into being and brings tremendous joy to us.<br> <br>
There is a message therein between life and death. For Life and death are in the Hands of Our Lord.
The Divine Connector has got a message. In Jesus Christ we are all one for eternity. 
We are all interconnected. Heaven & Earth.
Thank you, Jesus.<br> <br>
My late Mum will definitely be rejoicing over the birth of her great granddaughter Abigail Nicholas. (Abigail means My Father's Joy)</span></a>
