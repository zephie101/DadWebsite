            <h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the YouTube video below.</h2>
            <p>On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London. Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park. In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung, "Lead Kindly Light".</p>

            <h2>The Hymn below, Lead Kindly Light radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</h2>
            <h2>Prayer meetings of this nature are mandatory.</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight"><b>Ephesians 6:18</b></span><br>
            <span class="highlight">And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.</span><br><br>
            <b>Ephesians 6:13</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">Therefore put on God's complete armour, that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [of danger], and, having done all [the crisis demands], to stand [firmly in your place].</span><br><br>
            There is an evil day of danger which unfortunately will afflict, visit and confront everyone on the face of this earth. No one will escape this evil day of visitation. The question is how do you confront this day?<br>
            The next 5 or 6 daily readings will address this issue.<br><br>
            I would like to cite a story of a day that happened to be a very sad day and how God the Father took care of me and ministered to me in a unique way.<br><br>
            On the 28th of August 1995 we took a train (British rail) to go to church, near Wimbledon, South London. The train passed a graveyard and I am sure I must have seen this graveyard before on our visits to this church, but on this occasion this particular scene was passing a relevant message to me. As the train moved along the track, behold, we passed another graveyard and this time the message was very clear. I sensed God The Holy Ghost was preparing me for my dear mum's demise. When we came back from church I was very aware what was going to await me for this day. That evening I decided to go for a camp meeting and Our Lord graciously favoured me to hear an anointed man from America, a man they refer to as the preaching machine, the Rev. T. D. Jakes himself. He preached his heart out and than he stopped and asked everyone to stand up. As I stood up he asked each one standing beside each other to start praying for their neighbour. A Nigerian lady whom I have never met before, laid her hands on me and began to pray for me. She began to pray in tongues quietly and than the tongue went up to a higher crescendo. The lady started praying louder and louder and violently. Some way or other this praying began to minister to my spirit. Only when I came back home I realised what the praying was all about.<br><br>
            For whilst the lady was praying for me, at that same precise time which was about 8-15pm, my mum was breathing her last breath in Malaysia. God the Holy Ghost used the praying in tongues to strengthen my spirit to receive this sad news. The Presence of God compassionately comforted me and my spirit remained strong for the whole day. The preaching of the Lord's Word and the praying in the Spirit kept me emotionally stable.<br><br>
            <b>Matthew 13:11</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">Jesus replied, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12 Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance</span><br><br>
            We are living in a day of amazing sights of the Glory of God -- where the power of God is visibly manifesting Himself and as a parallel truth we are also witnessing daily, circumstances and events of terrible and unbearable tragedies.<br>
            We better learn to discern God's voice. God wants us to hear correctly because He loves us deeply.<br><br>
            <b>John 10:14-15 &amp; 27</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">"I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me just as the Father knows me and I know the Father ...<br>
            My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</span><br><br>
            My wife, Saida was desperately praying how to contact me at the camp meeting. For she wanted to pass the sad news to me that my dear Mum has died. When I came back home and told her what happened to me at the camp meeting she was so blessed to hear how God The Holy Spirit ministered to me in a very special way!</p>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
