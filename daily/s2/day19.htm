            <h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the YouTube video below.</h2>
            <p>On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London. Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park. In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung, "Lead Kindly Light".</p>

            <h2>The Hymn below, Lead Kindly Light radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</h2>
            <h2>Prayer meetings of this nature are mandatory.</h2>

            <p><span class="highlight"><b>Ephesians 6:18</b></span><br>
            <span class="highlight">And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.</span><br><br>
            <b>Ephesians 6:13</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">Therefore put on God's complete armour, that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [of danger], and, having done all [the crisis demands], to stand [firmly in your place].</span><br><br>
            Thank God for His mercy and graciousness, I can still visualise it till today, when God The Holy Ghost granted me this honour and the privilege of seeing a prophetic vision and witnessing it coming to pass in it's full manifestation in April 1983. In July 1979, in a three dimensional picture image, Our Lord showed me a marriage scene of me getting married. From this vision I had no idea who this lady was, I was getting married to. I will relate this vision for another day's reading but today I want to concentrate on this theme: <span class="highlight">keep on praying for all the saints.</span><br><br>
            The minute the marriage vision was confirmed to me, I decided I ought to begin to intercede, supplicate and pray for this lady in the vision. Thank God I hearkened to our Lord's instructions.<br><br>
            It was one summer day in 1981, when someone knocked on the main door of where Saida was residing. On this day she was all alone in this Christian community house. When Saida opened the door, it was a man who wanted to know whether there were any nurses residing in the house. She immediately responded by saying, "no". Than he asked a further question whether there were any other nurses staying nearby and she again responded in the negative. Till today she is amazed, astounded and bewildered on what came upon her, to block her mind to respond in the negative. For Saida who is a qualified Staff nurse was off duty on that day and there were two other nurses residing in that community house.<br><br>
            A few weeks later, a London newspaper reported as a headline, that a man pressed a doorbell of a flat in the South London area. The nurse who was staying upstairs was expecting her boyfriend to visit her. Assuming it was her boyfriend, her friend opened the door. Tragically the nurse was stabbed to death and the man showed no mercy to her. He also harmed her friend. The only way her friend escaped death was she had to "feign death".<br><br>
            <span class="highlight"><b>It's so, so important to pray for our Beloved ones.</b></span><br><br>
            Daily our household echoes with this prayer. Father God protect me, Saida, Paul, Jannine, Valerie and the whole Nicholas, Baloo and Meilton families from all forms of dangers, sicknesses, diseases, accidents, ailments, curses and afflictions of the dirty devil and all kinds of robbers, muggers, blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes, all kinds of cancer, tumour pains, back pains, poison, murder plots and all kinds of hay fever symptoms, knee pains, joint pains, demonic viruses and natural and spiritual attacks of the devil.<br>
            Protect our cars and homes too, Father God.<br>
            Preserve our jobs and blessings. Safeguard our journeys too, Father.<br><br>
            <b>Luke 18:1</b><br>
            <span class="highlight">Parables on Prayer<br>
            Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart,</span><br><br>
            Please do not lose heart!</p>

                <img src="../../images/profiles/grad_val.jpg" alt="Paul's graduation ceremony"><br>
                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

                Photo of Jannine Nicholas being admitted to her BA (Hons) degree in Law in her graduation ceremony at the Senate House, University of Cambridge on 28th June 2012. This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>
                "By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

                My Dad is positioned in the centre of this photograph. You will observe that a photograph of my late Mum can be seen in the background. It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
