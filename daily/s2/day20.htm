            <p><span class="highlight"><b>Matthew 5</b><br>
            <sup>14)</sup> "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup>15)</sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup>16)</sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven".</span><br><br>
            <span class="highlight"><b>Matthew 5 - Salt and Light</b><br>
            <sup>13)</sup> You are the salt of the earth.</span></p>

            <p>I used to lead a prayer meeting every Tuesday morning at the upstairs hall in St. Marks Church, opposite the Oval Tube Station in London. After the meeting was over we would get into a mini cab to take us back home. Someway or other we would get into a conversation with the mini cab driver and very naturally it evolved into a spiritual conversation. Some of them would be interested to know why we got up so early in the morning to come for a prayer meeting and this gave us the opportunity to discuss the Lordship of Jesus Christ and the precious sayings of the Bible.<br><br>
            I have lost count now how many mini cab drivers I have spoken to about the Kingdom of God, including giving them various tracks, tapes, books and Bibles. <b><span class="highlight">(A man and a woman of God must always be armed with spiritual tools. Whenever an occasion or an opportunity arises, we must always be ever ready to freely give out a Bible, a tract, a tape or even Christian magazines or journals!).</span></b> Sow and sow for the Kingdom of God, for the reaping of it will excite you. Opportunities sometimes only come once. Please do not let them pass you by!<br><br>
            On one occasion I was walking with our daughter Jannine around the market area in Peckham, South London. A man walked up to me and began to speak to me. It took me a few minutes to recognise him. He was one of the minicab drivers, I used to speak to about our Lord. I then proceeded to ask him what he was doing with himself now. I was so glad to hear that he had become a Manager of a minicab firm. Then he told me something which initially pleasantly shocked me. (But why should it shock me!) He testified to me that he was now a born again Christian and he was presently a Pastor. His church members now refer to him as Pastor Tony Chukuma. (Thank You, Jesus)<br><br>
            I was actually curious to find out who brought him to the Lord. Guess what his answer was? He said, "You Anton".<br><br>
            I was thunder bolted that my conversation to him about Jesus Christ and the Word of God in his minicab actually bore fruit and what a fruitful fruit.<br><br>
            So keep on gossiping the Good News. One will never know what you will reap for sowing the Good News.<br><br>
            <b>I would like to quote the words of Oswald Chambers, for there is a dynamic revelation therein, "If one has a passion for souls, could it be due to your own salvation which has made such a practical change in you that you would part with your right hand to drive every individual to the Kingdom of God too?</b><br><br>

                Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br>
                Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br><br>
                The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="../../profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="../../profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.

Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya. <b>Due to the date references he is recognised as one of the first Asian bankers in the history of British Colonial Malaya.</b><br>
