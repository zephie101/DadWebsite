<h2> A pattern of prayer</h2> 

       
       <p>

<span class="highlight">
<b> Romans 1: 9-10</b> 
<br> God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness <b>how constantly I remember you in my prayers at all times;</b>
<br> <br>
<b> Romans 12:12</b> 
<br> Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, <b>faithful in prayer</b>
<br> <br>
<b> 1 Thessalonians 3:10</b> 
<br> [And we] continue to pray especially <b>and with most intense earnestness night and day</b>
</span>
<br> <br>
 One of my greatest joys in life is to link up with individuals who love praying. These are individuals who have a passionate desire to pray. Prayer for them has become a habitual pattern, a lifestyle.
<br><br>
I remember the time when I used to live in the Oval area in South London. A friend of mine and I used to pray on an occasional Friday. He joined me in prayer during the early hours of the morning. This activity refreshed and strengthened our spirit, soul, body and mind. Our prayer echoed this scriptural theme, <span class="highlight">
<b> Psalm 85:6 </b> Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? </span> We took turns in reading aloud passages from the very fascinating Book of Psalms.
<br> <br>
Just at this moment, (2009) I am recollecting back my, “ all night” prayer times at the Prayer shrine, at the Grotto in Lourdes, France. It was on this occasion that I spent praying through the night with my Catholic priest friend, a Jesuit, the late Reverend Father Hugh Thwaites. (I only heard recently 2013-that he passed away last year). His spirit just loved praying. It’s amazing that when one soaks himself in prayer and then moves on from that foundation to start preaching--- from your mouth will come forth gems, meaning words of wisdom.
<br> <br>
Till today I can still remember a sermon talk given by this praying Jesuit priest, Father Thwaites, although this talk was delivered 20 years ago.
<br> <br>
Let me tell this story which was mentioned in his sermon talk given at Our Lady of the Rosary, Brixton Road. He was citing a story of a Christian family of 4 members who were sadly involved in a car crash. Both the mother and the father died on the spot. The children were injured but not critical. The son got very, very angry with God for taking away both his parents all so suddenly and he decided to renounce his faith. His sister did exactly the opposite thing. She decided to take up Holy Orders and follow the path of becoming a closed order Nun. This meant the sister spent most of the time in the monastery, praying.
<br> <br>
One particular day her brother was riding his motorbike and got involved in an accident, unfortunately it was a serious accident. A priest was called to attend to him at the local hospital and to offer him his last rites. The brother was still conscious and when he saw the priest praying for him , the brother got very angry. The priest was still gracious enough to ask him whether he wanted to accept Jesus Christ as his Lord and Saviour. The young man opened  his mouth and spat at the priest. The priest took out his handkerchief and wiped the spit from his face and blessed the young man and left the ward. During the early hours of the morning the boy drifted into unconsciousness and died.
<br> <br>
The burden fell upon the priest to ring up the boy’s sister in the closed order monastery and to inform her that her brother sadly died and to confirm the funeral arrangements.
<br> <br>
The priest made no mention of the incident in the ward because he did not want to hurt her, but before he could place the receiver down, the sister interrupted him and asked him a question, “could you please tell me Reverend, did my brother spit on your face?” The priest was so shocked to hear this that he replied back with a question, “Who told you this?” The sister went on to tell him that while she was praying, our Lord showed her a vivid vision. She saw her brother spitting at the priest and observed the priest wiping the spit from his face with a handkerchief. Than she went on to tell the priest that while her brother was drifting into unconsciousness, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself appeared to her brother and asked whether he wanted to spit on His face too. The brother responded by saying ,“No”. Than Jesus asked him a question whether he wanted to accept Him as his Lord and Saviour, and her brother replied, “Yes”. Than he breathed his last and went to be with Our Lord.
<br> <br>
Can you imagine, how this vision would have enhanced the faith of the priest especially being related to him by a praying nun?

 <h2 >Lead Kindly Light.
<br> The Hymn below radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</h2> 
            
 <p> John Henry Newman, who was a young English Priest, wrote the Hymn Lead Kindly Light when he was afflicted with a serious illness. This occurred whilst staying in the island of Sicily which is situated near Italy. He was far from home and really believed he was facing death. In one extraordinary moment, which I refer to it as a touch from the Lord, The Blessed Cardinal Newman wrote this very moving hymn. It will definitely minister to all those who are facing loneliness, darkness and confusion.  <br><br>
                
                 Visitors from all over the world have seen this video.
This will be an anointed final Hymn to sing in all churches when we finally depart, smartly dressed and in our coffins to be truly and warmly welcomed by our Beloved Saviour, Our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth into the glorious splendour of Heaven.</span>
<b><br><br>
                On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
            Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
            In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
            “Lead Kindly Light”. </b>

                The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><i><b>8th January 2014.</b></i></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business.
