<b> Deuteronomy 6:6-8</b> 
<br> 6) These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. <b> 7) Impress them on your children.</b> Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 8 Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
<br> <br>
<b> Psalm 34:10-11</b> 
<br> 10) The lions may grow weak and hungry, 
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
<br>
11) Come, my children, listen to me; 
I will teach you the fear of the LORD .
<br> <br>
<b> Isaiah 54:12-13</b> 
<br> 12) I will make your battlements of rubies, 
your gates of sparkling jewels, 
and all your walls of precious stones. 
<br>
13) All your sons will be taught by the LORD , 
<b> and great will be your children's peace </b>

Our son Paul is now in his second year at the University and our daughter Jannine is now attending senior school. We were very aware that we only had a precious limited period of time where we had to formulate, impress within their spirits to follow the precepts of the above scriptures. We knew within the age period of 4 to 9 years old we had to get the victory of these concepts within our two children to befriend Jesus as a natural process. We started praying for both our children the minute they were formed within Saida’s womb. Our belief and conviction was shared and practised with our children, that our household will be a place where we will honour, cherish and love our Lord Jesus Christ, where we will acknowledge God the Father as our own Dear Father and call upon and remind God the Holy Spirit to be always Present and abiding in our home and guiding our lives daily.
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Proverbs 22:6</b> 
<br> Train up a child in the way he should go, Even when he is old he will not depart from it. 
</font>
<br> <br>
We knew we had to get our children to love the Word of God. Proverbs 22 verse 6 was fore-front in our minds. Both Paul and Jannine began to write out the books of the bible in their own handwriting at a very young age. Daily we prayed with them, either in the morning or in the evening. We also shared with them this thought that the words in the bible are life sustaining messages, so we read the Word Of God aloud on a daily basis.

Selwyn Hughes actually utilised his precious time to write some comments to my daily reading. It's worth a read!</a>
 <br> <br>
We made sure every Sunday we went to church as a family. They accompanied us on all our holidays within the United Kingdom and abroad.  Whenever problems or afflictions hit our family we went down on our knees and made supplication and intercession to our Heavenly Father to intervene and help us. The children observed and took note how our Heavenly Father responded to our intercession and the manner our prayers were answered. This enhanced their faith, when they noted God is real. When they were very young our children caught our passion for Jesus. I remember when Jannine was between 4-5 years old, she suddenly got up from her deep sleep between 1and 2 am and insisted on reciting the Lord's prayer. She went back to sleep after reciting the whole Lord's Prayer very slowly. When Paul was about 6 years old, he announced to me, that when he grows up he wants to become the Chancellor of The Exchequer of Great Britain. My only regret now is that I dismissed this thought of his almost immediately, by suggesting to him that someone of ethnic origin would find it very difficult to attain this position. I just wish I told him that with God everything is possible!!
 <br> <br>
 We have done our part and we have joyfully invested lots of precious time in their lives. Our present vision for our children is to see Paul becoming President of the Christian Union at Cambridge University and to proclaim the Word of Our Lord prophetically and for our daughter Jannine to secure a place at Oxford University and to become a top Barrister in the country and a champion proclaimer for our Lord Jesus Christ and His Kingdom. We pray as a barrister she will stand up for justice for the poor and the forsaken.
 <br> <br>
We will continue to sustain them in prayer, intercession and supplication.
 <br> 
May they become prayer warriors in their own right
 <br> 
Holy Ghost, thank you for being our Great Friend
 <br> 
Glory be to God
 <br> <br>
<i> Just For Meditation: ( The words of Mr. Swindoll Senior)
<br>
   You sow a thought you reap an act, you sow an act you reap a habit, you sow your habit you reap a character, you sow your character you reap a destiny!
<br> 
Someone said this, "The blessings  follow the children  whenever the parents are totally obedient to the will of God in their lives. Point for meditation. </i>

        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.
        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>
