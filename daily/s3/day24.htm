<h1>Brethren, the Sowing and Reaping Principle always works: Be assured there is no failure when following this Principle</h1>
<h2>but firstly allow God The Holy Ghost to mould you and conform you to the image of Our Lord Jesus Christ. May His Characteristics fashion your life.</h2>
<p>
<span class="scripture-reference">
<b>Luke 21:1-4</b><br/>
                    Just then Jesus looked up and saw the rich people dropping offerings in the collection plate. Then he saw a poor widow put in two pennies. He said, "The plain truth is that this widow has given by far the largest offering today. All these others made offerings that they'll never miss; <b>she gave extravagantly what she couldn't afford—she gave her all!</b>"
                </span>
<br/><br/>
<span class="scripture-reference">
<b>2 Corinthians 9:6-7</b><br/>
                    Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
                </span>
<br/><br/>
                I need to link these two above scriptures with this following scripture.
                <br/><br/>
<span class="scripture-reference">
<b>Matthew 6:25-27 Do Not Worry</b><br/>
                    "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?"
                </span>
<br/><br/>
                I have taken great note of our Heavenly Father’s tremendous love for us through the above words of our Lord Jesus in reference to Matthew 6 verse 25, that He cares for us through and through! At the same time I also need to testify that the principle of sowing and reaping is a reality. One accepts it works in a natural environment, for example in a farming arena, given all the natural conditions are right, when a farmer sows seeds, he reaps an abundant harvest. This principle also seems to operate in a parallel basis when we sow financial seeds into churches and organizations which expand and proclaim the Kingdom of God and thereby pulling down and demolishing the Kingdom of darkness. This sacrificial giving someway or other prompts God The Holy Ghost to favour us in multiple ways with a blessing, financially and spiritually. We know it because it has happened to us. Too many testimonies to relate here.
                <br/><br/>
                As a principle, sowing and reaping definitely works. Please read the words of God The Father below:
                <br/><br/>
                I am always struck with awe in regard to the magnificence and the magnitude of this particular verse
                <br/><br/>
<span class="scripture-reference">
<b>Malachi 3:10</b><br/>
                    "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it."
                </span>
<br/><br/>
<b>What a challenge, what a promise and what a reward. He is actually asking us to test Him in this.</b>
</p>
<h2>Make sure all the spiritual conditions are right</h2>
<p>
                Our report is that whenever we have <b>given money sacrificially</b> to, a) various Christian organizations that are obeying the mandate of our Lord, b) Christian ministries that are fruitful and c) churches that have an evangelistic vision which also must include in their outreach to help the poor and the destitute of the third world countries, God The Father has always blessed us back abundantly financially.
                <br/><br/>
                For we cannot out give God.
                <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
                (The above photograph was taken on 23rd August 2008. To celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary we took our family to this grand Cameron Highlands Resort, 5000 feet above sea level, opposite a only spectacular 18 hole golf course, Tanah Rata, Pahang, Darul Makmur, Malaysia. We convey our thanks to my youngest brother Fintan for getting this memorable celebration so well orchestrated!)

<img alt="Nicholas family at Carcosa Seri Negara" src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/main/Lake_Gardens.jpg"/>
<br/><br/>
                During our last visit to Malaysia, 2009, we stopped to have high tea at the Carcosa Seri Negara Hotel, located near the beautiful Lake Gardens in Kuala Lumpur. We chose to have an English afternoon tea when someone told us that the British Monarch, Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince Consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh stayed in this grand hotel. The first to live in this seven-bedroom/nine-bathroom mansion was British Resident-General Sir Frank Swettenham in 1896. We also celebrated part of Paul's birthday there.
                <br/><br/>
                Do Watch the Video of Anton Speaking on You Tube showing exactly how God the Father was deeply involved in the affairs of the Nicholas family regarding the purchase of a house.
                <br/><br/>
                The principle of tithes and offerings played a major part here. View and you will understand it! (Our apologies about the picture and voice quality)
                <br/><br/>
                We pray that you will just hear and meditate on the major points of the testimony: the process and the Godly instructions we received on how to purchase a property. Even to just hear Joy Muttiah, the youngest daughter to Pastor Roy, play an anointed piece of music on the piano is something which will deeply touch you.

<h2>Flag Counter</h2>
<p>
                The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><b>8th January 2014.</b></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business. As a result we lost all our treasured statistics.
                <br/><br/>
                We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm. It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth!
