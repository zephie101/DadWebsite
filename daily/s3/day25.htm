<p>Reading for Day 25</p>

<p>Watch out for there are people eavesdropping all around you</p>
</b></u>
<p></p>
<b>
<p>                                                         
</p></b><u><b>Philippians 4</b></u>
<p><b>                                                   
</b></p><b>    <u>The Lord is near. 
</u><sup>
<p>6) </p>  Do not be anxious about anything, 
but in everything, by prayer and petition, with 
thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7)  And the peace of God, which 
transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ 
Jesus. <br/>
8)  Finally, brothers, whatever is 
true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is 
lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think 
about such things. 9)  Whatever you 
have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it into practice. 
And the God of peace will be with you. 
</sup></b>
<p>It was October 1978, I was walking with a young man down a hill, whom I had 
just met at a Christian conference. The meeting was held at the renown Catholic 
Cathedral called St. John�s in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This guy was sharing with 
me his problems and his most pressing need was to secure a permanent job. He was 
trying to convince me that the chances of him getting a job were practically 
zilch. I responded by saying to him that he has firstly got to learn to trust 
our Lord and I expounded further by saying to him that the opposite word in 
biblical terms to worry is trust. There was a heavy traffic passing to and fro 
on this hill we were walking on and this guy asked me nicely to speak a bit 
louder. So I responded. I spoke slightly loudly, saying, �You've got to learn to 
trust our Precious Lord, and you have got to keep on reminding Jesus that you 
will always trust Him and than see how He opens up the window of opportunities 
for you! Momentarily I was distracted, for I heard a car hooting. So I turned 
around and I noticed it was a Catholic nun whom I had never met before and she 
placed her hand out of the window and gave me a thumbs up. She raised her voice 
and told me that she had heard what I said and she liked it and her face was 
radiating with joy. It looked like she just needed to hear that particular word 
at that particular moment and at that particular time I was expressing it.</p>
<p>So we have to be careful of our words when we are in a public realm. Make 
sure your words transform and renew the lives of people around you and be 
especially alert in your work environment.</p>
<p></p><b><u>John 1<br/>
</u><sup>1)   In the beginning 
was the Word, 
and the Word 
was with God, and the 
Word was God. 
2)     He was with God in the 
beginning.
</sup></b>

<p><u>Proverbs 16 (verse 20)</u></p>
<p><b>He who gives attention to the word shall find good, And blessed is he who 
trusts in the LORD. </b></p>
