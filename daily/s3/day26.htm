<b><u>
<p>Reading for Day 26</p>

<p>James 5</p>
</u><sup>
<p>15) b) The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and 
effective.</p>
</sup>
<p><u>Look at this next verse as an example of a powerful prayer. <br/>
</u></p><sup>17) Elijah was a man just like us. 
He prayed earnestly that it 
would not rain, and it did not rain 
on the land for three and a half years. 
</sup></b>
<p>It was whilst we were in Malaysia that we met a very special priest. The late 
Father De Crue. Although he was of French descent, he was a very natural 
Malaysian by his manners and behaviour. His ministry was unique, one of a kind. 
Our Lord anointed him to cast out evil and foul spirits from human beings. He 
cited to us many case histories of people being set free and delivered of cruel 
possession of unclean spirits. </p>
<p>I do not want to concentrate on this aspect here but I really want to stress 
an important revelation point, of how he protected himself after fulfilling 
Our Lord�s ministry. He sometimes spent the whole night praying in front of the 
blessed Altar in the church. He was very aware that the devil hated him, for 
this anointed priest was demolishing and pulling down strongholds and drawing 
people towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Reflecting about the late Father Decrue, and how he protected himself has 
produced this conviction in me that we really ought to pray for Mel Gibson and 
for all those who are involved in the production of the anointed film,  the
</p><b>Passion of the Christ</b>. 
I have now heard so many powerful stories/ testimonies of the motion picture 
that Mel Gibson has directed. This film ought to become a Holy Ghost inspiring 
Evangelistic tool. It�s trying to depict a real portrayal of the last 12 hours of 
the life of Jesus and His Resurrection. The Ash Wednesday of 2004 is going to be 
an important day. For this is the day which has been chosen for the film to be 
released in various theatres in the USA. Our prayer is that through this film a 
great revival may break out in the entire world.
<p>I happened to catch a programme on BBC television where I saw the actor, Jim 
Caviezel, playing the role of Jesus, talking about his Christian Faith. His 
words and how he conducted himself on this programme really impressed me. I than 
saw him praying in a church. This is when I thought of Father De Crue and how 
this priest stayed in close intimacy with Jesus, by praying daily.</p>
<p>May the blood of Jesus Christ protect everybody who is involved in this film 
and may this motion picture impact everyone who watches it.</p>
<p></p>
<u><b>
<p>Matthew 26</p>
</b></u><b><sup>
<p>53) </p>Don't you realize that I am able 
right now to call to my Father, and twelve companies--more, if I want them--of 
fighting angels would be here, battle-ready? 
54) But if 
I did that, how would the Scriptures come true that say this is the way it has 
to be?"
<p>                                                           
</p></sup>
Mark 15
<i>
<p><u>The Death of Jesus </u>
</p></i><u><br/>
</u><sup>33) At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth 
hour. 34) And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
</sup>
<p>"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"</p>
<p>--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</p>
