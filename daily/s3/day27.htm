<b><u>
<p>Prayer</p>

<p></p>
<p>Reading for Day 27</p>

<p>In the morning </p></u>. . . He, ( Jesus) 
went out and departed to a <u>solitary place</u>; 
and there <u>He ( Jesus) prayed</u>. 
�Mark 1:35</b> 

<p>Thank you, Heavenly Father, what an example, what an act to follow.</p>
<p>Someway or other it came to my realisation, especially during my prayer 
times, that I need to preserve, His Presence, His Anointing on my life at all 
cost. I recollect when I used to work with the British Civil Service, I decided 
to maintain a pattern which means, having a discipline order in my life in regard 
to having a clear structured prayer life.</p>
<p>The </p><b>above verse </b>
produces a heavy reverberation-- for it impacts me in a way that 
I know that this is a key verse that one needs to meditate and cultivate, to 
maintain the anointing of God and the calling of God in our lives.
<p>Praying in the morning is so vital that it sustains our well being for the 
whole day. We have been exhorted to approach the Throne Room with confidence. 
Meditate on this verse:</p>
<b>
<p>Hebrews 4 <sup>16) Let us then </sup></p><sup><u>
fearlessly
</u>and 
<u>confidently</u> 
and <u>boldly</u> 
draw near to the throne of grace (the throne of God's unmerited favour to us 
sinners), that we may receive mercy [for our failures] and find grace to help in 
good time for every need [appropriate help and well-timed help, coming just when 
we need it].
</sup></b>
<p>The above Words </p><u><b>underlined in 
blue</b> </u>mean a lot to me. I love these words, 
<u>fearlessly</u>, <u>confidently </u>and <u>
boldly. </u>If we could only assimilate, absorb like a 
process of osmosis into our spirit the powerful impact of these three words, 
this will boost our prayer life. There will be an inner strength, a conviction 
that God The Father is taking note of our Prayers .
<b>
<p>Prayer </p></b>will protect, preserve, sustain us, minister 
to us, keep us close to our Creator Father God, refresh us, enlighten us. In 
times of tribulation, distress, affliction, suffering, 
<b>prayer</b> will 
strengthen the inner being. <b>Praying </b>
will reassure us that His 
<b><u>Grace</u> </b>is 
sufficient.
<b>
<p><u>2 Corinthians 12</u></p></b><u><br/>
</u><sup>9<b>) </b></sup><b>But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, 
for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more 
gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. 
<p><br/>
</p></b>So choose the moment to pray, praise, worship, 
intercede and supplicate. One can do any of these acts of reverence at any time, 
at any moment of the day, where ever we are at. At home, at work, in the 
bathroom, whilst at rest, walking etc. 
<p>Just from a point of experience, the early morning hour, before dawn, is the 
best hour!</p>
<p> </p>
