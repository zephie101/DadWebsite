       <h2> An introduction to Pastor Kingsley Appiagyei
and his church, Trinity Baptist Church.</h2> 

       
       <p class="main" align="left">

<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">

We received at short notice a tender invitation, in December 2024, from Trinity Baptist Church Croydon to attend the funeral service of our very loving friend Mrs Victoria Jane Asare Amosah.<br> <br>
We know Victoria as the wife to Reverend Kweku Amosah. <br>
He was a leader during the time when the late Nicholas Rivett Carnac and John Starr were the Vicars at St. Marks Church, Kennington.London.<br> <br>
We know the Amosahs very well. During the course of our spiritual journey we did attend Trinity Baptist Church and were mightily challenged and blessed.<br> <br>
What a glorious funeral. A precious home going.<br> <br> It was conducted as for a farewell service befitting a 'queen'.
The Praise and Worship was Throne Room level.
 </p>
</font>
       <p class="main" align="left">


For the last two years,Dec'2002 and Dec'2003, we felt it was somewhat mandatory from a prompting of God The Holy Spirit to attend the New Year Eve service at Trinity Baptist church,located in West Norwood, South London. This church has a congregation of more than a thousand people. It is during this time that the Pastor, Kingsley Appiagyei delivers his vision message, i.e. which is usually a prophetic message in regard to a dawning of a New Year. The service lasts for a long time, usually between 8 pm till 1am. We enjoy every minute of it. The praise and worship is superb. Very moving. The Presence of God is tangible, for God The Holy Ghost manifests His Presence. This is one of the many reasons why we like to attend the New Year service in this church. For the Praise and Worship is done in a reverential manner and this enables us to sense the Presence of God. We come back home at about 2am feeling that we have encountered a lasting experience with God.
<br> <br>
I would like to mention here some key points that Pastor Kingsley Appiagyei mentioned in his prophetic sermon.
<br> <br>
<b>May the Favour of God be Upon You.</b>
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> Genesis 39:2,20-23</b> 
<br> But the Lord was with Joseph, and he [though a slave] was a successful and prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
<br> But while Joseph was there in the prison, the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favour in the eyes of the prison warden. So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there. The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did. </font>
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b> 1 Chronicles 4:9-11</b> 
<br> Jabez was more honourable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, "I gave birth to him in pain." Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, "Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain."</font>
<br> <br>
<b>Favour will restore in a day, what the enemy stole in a lifetime.</b>
<br> <br>
<b>Uncommon Favour will come upon you!</b>
<br> <br>
<b> One day of Favour is worth a lifetime of labour.</b> (This sentence really blessed me) 
<br> <br>
<b> Favour is your ladder to Divine success. 
<br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
Psalm 127:1 </b> 
<br> Unless the LORD builds the house, 
<br> its builders labour in vain. 
<br> Unless the LORD watches over the city, 
<br> the watchmen stand guard in vain. </font>
<br> <br>
<b> Favour can silence a lifetime enemy for ever. </b> (Glory Be To God)
<br> <br>
<b> Favour will turn tragedy into triumph. 
<br> <font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
Job 42:10,12 </b>
<br> After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before. The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys. </font>
</p>

<p class="main">
Our hunger to get to know our Lord must be strong. I remember once 
sitting quietly in the local church, St. James the Great R.C. Church, Peckham Rye, in London, England, on 3rd April 
1993. My mind was distracted in wanting to follow my own ambitions 
and desires.<br> <br> I sensed the voice of Our Heavenly Father ministering to me
 and instructing me, “Why don’t you, Anton, pursue My Son and pursue Him
 intensely?"
<br> <br>
From that day on I decided to pursue this instruction meticulously.<br> <br> I had already graduated with a Banking Diploma from IFS University College,UK. <br> <br>

I came back home and gathered every single banking text book I owned plus all 
paraphernalia relating to my potential successful career. I placed them
neatly in a black garbage bag and threw them away. From then henceforth 
my challenging spiritual journey commenced.
<br> <br>
</p>
<p class="main">
On this Marriage Prophetic video below, where a father is directly speaking to his son, the essential truth on how to pray effectively with definite fruitful results will manifest themselves.<br> <br>  Paul Anton Imbaraj Nicholas is the first great grandson of the Banking Visionary B P Nicholas. Paul Nicholas has emulated the mantle of his great grandfather.<br> <br> Both videos of the wedding have now been viewed by more than 12,800 individuals. Our ANTONNICHOLAS You Tube Channel has been viewed by 257,000 individuals. <br><br>	</p>

 December 2005 we again celebrated the New Year with the Trinity Baptist congregation. Our Lord honoured and favoured the Church leadership this year by enabling them to have this service at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, Indoor Arena, Ledrington Road, Upper Norwood. We believe this stadium can cater for about 5000 people. 

<br> <br>
Inserted below is a photograph of our family taken during the service.       
<br> We are grateful to Mr. Kwabena Oteng-Kyei for taking this photo.
Time: 11-30 pm,31st Dec 2005.

We are all ready to eat a delicious meal at the Tiger Tiger Club located in Croydon , Surrey in honour of Pastor Amosah's birthday. It was a memorable occasion. This was a surprise party for Pastor Amosah! Celebrated on 6th July 2008.  ( Sitting on the far right is Anton, nearer to the picture is Saida, (sitting opposite to Saida) is Valerie and our daughter Jannine is sitting on the far left.) We also had some precious fellowship with Pastor Amosah's wife, Victoria Asare Kewku. Their children were present too, Hannah, Samuel and Josephine.

<b>
Trinity Baptist Church is an example of an arena that loves to pray and intercede.
</b> <br>
We all need to practise praying in order to become prayer warriors!

Watch this video of Anton speaking on YouTube showing exactly what was preciously shared about The Holy Ghost to the gathering in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and why he received their rapt attention.
<br> <br>
After preaching the anointed Word, Anton laid hands and prayed for the people in need. We were grateful for the Presence of The Holy Ghost. Do watch the video and we pray as you are viewing that the healing power of the cross of Jesus will touch you personally.
<br> <br>
The first segment of the video is shown below.

For over 13 years Dad (Anton) faithfully prayed and spoke the Word of our Lord aloud (the verses of the bible) every day, together with Jannine. Dad coached her on how to articulate the biblical verses, oozing and speaking them, percolated with the sweet fragrance of the Holy Spirit. To discern whether Dad has done a successful job, do hear a short rendition of her public reading at All Saints Church, Peckham on 19 July 2009 at the 10 am service:

<h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the You Tube video below.</h2> 
		<p class="main">On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
		 Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
		 In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
    “Lead Kindly Light”.
     <br>
     <br>
     <b> Watch the video below </b> and prayerfully observe on how strong the impartation of the Holy Ghost is. Do check it out and see whether the sweet Presence of the Holy Ghost touches you! You can only know through viewing the video.
     <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> It surely will, for moments of this nature are very rare. </FONT>

<b> James 5:16 (Amplified Bible) </b>
The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].
<br> <br>
<b> James 5:16 (New Century Version) </b>
 16) When a believing person prays, great things happen.
