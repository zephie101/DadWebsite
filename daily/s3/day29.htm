		<h2>I decided to attend a very large Charismatic Conference where I was ministered to by the excellent teaching, praise and worship. It will fascinate you to read what happened to me after I left the meeting and how total strangers came to my rescue.</h2> 
		<p class="main"><FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <i> Finally after a 20 year break two members of my family will be attending Faith Camp 2014, at Peterborough Arena in The East of England Showground,Cambridgeshire.<br> <br>We have been following the teaching of Pastor Colin Urquhart over so many years now. He excites us towards revival and how to pray passionately. He is the founder of Kingdom Faith.Our first visit to Faith Camp was in Summer 1984. We first met the late Reverend Bob Gordon in 1984 with the prospect of joining Kingdom Faith Bible School.</i> </font> </p>
	<p class="main"> We were in the Eastern part of England, attending Faith Camp 1994.
<br> <br>
One evening, I left my family resting at a high rated 5 star hotel and I decided to attend the evening charismatic meeting on my own, which was held in a big tent. The tent was about 3 to 4 miles from where we were staying. It was during those days when we did not use our car and relied on Public Transport. The location where we were staying was in the countryside so this meant that the transport was not brilliant. So I decided to walk to the conference. Given the fact that the sun was still bright, I felt confident and secure to walk in this unknown place. My walk to the conference tent took me along some farm roads. Thankfully, I managed to find the tent where the conference was taking place. AS a guess, I would say there were about 3000-4000 people sitting in the tent. The praise and worship was moving and inspiring.The preaching of the Word of God was electrifying and challenging, followed by miraculous signs and wonders.
<br> <br>
When the meeting came to an end I had to make my way back to the hotel. As I left the tent an idea suddenly bloomed that maybe I should ask someone from the gathering, to give me a lift. My eyes were transfixed on an elderly couple who were driving a grand car. I ran towards them and asked them very kindly whether they could give me a lift to the hotel. They said sure and asked me to jump in and I joyfully responded.
<br> <br>
There is something I need to mention here, a particular aspect in my life, where the Holy Ghost is still working.Although I must say there has been a tremendous improvement since 1994--- it’s to do with my sense of location.( I need a gifting in Geography or Map reading!).
<br> <br>
I mentioned the name of the hotel to the couple, but neither of them knew its whereabouts. At that moment they were actually more concerned about locating the exact wave length of a Christian radio broadcast that was being relayed from the camp.
<br> <br>
Guess what they did? They dumped me near a big round about and asked me to find my way back to the hotel. I was completely lost. The only salvation was that I could still hear the singing from the camp site. So I decided to follow where the singing was coming from. I got dreadfully lost. I found myself in pitch darkness.(No mobile phones in 1994). The only time I could see anything was when a car passed by. The head lights of the cars showed me that I was, surrounded by trees and wild hedges. I tried to wave down a couple of cars, but they were reluctant and too frightened to stop.Sometimes I wonder whether I would have stopped had  I seen a stranger in the middle of a very dark road. It would have needed an authentic Word from God The Holy Ghost to stop. I gave up on trying to stop these cars as I felt it was a waste of time. Suddenly, out of the blue, a horrible presence of fear attacked me viciously. I remembered a very sad newspaper article which I had recently read in the Sunday Times. The contents of the article overwhelmed me with fear. I remembered the headline, “ Where do you come from my lovely”. It was referring to the body of a young beautiful lady who was discovered in a ditch just outside the Lincolnshire village of Coleby. The police noted that she had been severely beaten before she was dumped in the ditch, but apparently she had not died immediately as the blows rained down. Death came several hours later from aspiration pneumonia due to her injuries and from lying face-down. The presence of fear overwhelmed me. My mouth was parched, my hands were clammy and my heart beat very fast. 
<br> <br>
I heard the sound of many footsteps. I was also very aware of ditches all around me. Remember the whole surroundings were in complete darkness. A car came along. From the car lights I noticed there were three young men coming my way. I did not like the look of them. A few words came forth from my mouth, “ Oh, Jesus, please do not let them see me”! Thank God the Presence of God blinded them and they did not see me. It was during this juncture that the Holy Ghost must have known that my being could not take any more tension. For all kind of thoughts were swirling inside me. For one moment I felt I would not see my family again. For the second time I heard some voices. I tried to look at the direction they were coming from. At the same time praying a thought into fruition that a car might come along. For I needed the car lights to see who these people were. My prayer was answered instantly. As the lights flashed from the car, I observed  that there were two young men riding their bicycles along this road. I was so glad to see them and so excited to see their complexion as they were similar to me. I saw them as friendly. I ran towards them and I told them that I was so happy to see them. I said that I was completely lost in this 'jungle area' and could they please help me to find my way back to the hotel. Blessed be the Name OF Jesus, they helped me. In all my excitement I forgot to ask them their names. Later on I was wondering what on earth they were doing in this place of darkness? Were they angels sent by our Lord to help me! I was so glad to see my family again.
