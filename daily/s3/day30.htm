       <h2> I devoured these Saintly books voraciously. </h2> 

       
       <p class="main" align="left">
The Don Bosco magazines came to our home in Malaysia from, Matunga, Bombay, India. From the age of seven or eight I began to seriously read each page. I suddenly realised I was not reading them just for the sake of a read but I was absorbing the articles very passionately. I began to imitate some of the saints written about in the pages. I would read the books of these saints over and over again. They created such an impression in my life, that I wanted to talk like them, dress up like them and also to copy their spiritual activities. Their lifestyles were being ingrained in me. After reading these books I would spontaneously kneel down and pray. This is the effect of the saints in the books, so I followed their style. Then I moved on one degree further and began to read books about the compassionate heart of Jesus, exemplified by the lifestyles of St. Dominic Saviour, St Therese of Liseux and St. Anthony of Padua. I found these books fascinating and their lifestyles compelling. I was drawn like a magnet to find the key for spiritual growth! It was obvious these saints had a passionate love for Jesus. <br> <br>
When I arrived in London, in the middle of the 1970’s, my spiritual growth moved on to another dimension. I decided to go on spiritual pilgrimages, attend revival meetings, camp meetings and anointed prayer meetings. I heard so many men and women of God preaching and proclaiming the Word of God powerfully. Every evening I would painstakingly go through my radio wave bands to scout for Christian spiritual items that uplifted my spiritual life.
<br> <br>
I must confess that there are still some religious aspects experienced during my childhood days that till today affect me in an incredible way. An example being, when Our Lord’s Prayer is sung passionately and slowly in Latin. This singing just draws me into the Presence of God.
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
<b>Please do pray The Lord's Prayer daily.</b> <br> <br>
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your Name,<br> <br>
Your kingdom come,
your will be done,<br> <br>
On earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.<br> <br>
Forgive us our sins 
as we forgive those 
   who sin against us.<br> <br>
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.<br> <br>
<b>[For the kingdom, the power,<br><br>
   and the glory are Yours<br> <br>
now and for ever.] Amen.</b> <br> <br>


<b> Blessed Be The Name of Jesus Christ </b> <br>
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.
<br> <i>
In name of-Father and of-Son and of-Spirit Holy.
<br> </i>
Pater noster, qui es in caelis,
<br> <i>
Father our who are in Heaven
<br> </i>
sanctificetur nomen tuum.
<br> <i>
may-be-hallowed name Your
<br> </i>
Adveniat regnum tuum.
<br> <i>
may-come kingdom Your
<br> </i>
Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra.
<br> <i>
may-be-done will Your as in Heaven and in earth.
<br> </i>
Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,
<br> <i>
bread our daily give us today
<br> </i>
et dimitte nobis debita nostra,
<br> <i>
and forgive us debts our
<br> </i>
sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
<br> <i>
as and we forgive debtors our
<br> </i>
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem:
<br> <i>
and don't us lead in temptation
<br> </i>
sed libera nos a malo. Amen.
<br> <i>
but free us from evil  Amen
    <br> </i>
</font>
<br> <br>
<b> Mark Chapter 8 verse 35
<br>
     Only those who throw away their lives for My Sake and for the sake of the Good News will ever know what it means to really live.

        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from 
        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is 
        pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family 
        member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.

        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 
        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 
        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.
        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>
        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.
        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> The conditions are steep for Jannine </b> </a>
         she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
