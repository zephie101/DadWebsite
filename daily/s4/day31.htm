<font style="background-color: #FEF1B5"> 
<b> Psalm 51:17 </b>
My sacrifice [the sacrifice acceptable] to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart [broken down with sorrow for sin and humbly and thoroughly penitent], such, O God, You will not despise.
 </font> <br> <br>
 </p>
       <p class="main" align="left">
I worked for the British Civil Service for a couple of years. Each day, before I went to work I practised and maintained a certain discipline. I will get up very early in the morning, just before 5am, and I will start praying, meditating, worshiping and adoring God The Father and than I will proceed to bless Our Lord Jesus Christ and I will also make sure I acknowledge the Presence of God The Holy Ghost. I will read the Word of God and than listen to some Praise and Worship songs. Than suddenly I will realize that I better start getting dressed up. I will start rushing to get change to my work attire and run, grasping for breath to catch the British Rail, in time.
<br> <br>        
When I am in the office getting on with my work, a few thoughts will flow through my mind------ and the thoughts will go along this line. Surely but surely, God The Father has got better plans for me, than just working for an organization, at a mediocre, mundane level and receiving an average pay. I decided it's high time I raise myself above the level of mediocrity. My first stage of action was to read Deuteronomy Chapter 28, prayerfully, in a spirit of meditation.
<br> <br> 
   <font style="background-color: #FEF1B5"> 
   <b> Deuteronomy 28:13 </b> <br>
   The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. <b> If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD </b> your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.       
 <br> <br>  </font>
 I really began to believe, with a deep conviction that in accordance with the above scripture, God The Father has got something better for me to accomplish in life.
 <br> <br>
I must confess at the outset here that part of my thought patterns were heavily influenced by some of the articles I used to read, about how Asians, who originally came from different Continents to settle in the United Kingdom, with only about £5 to £10 pounds in their pockets are now Managing Directors of various multi - million pound companies. I do admire this kind of people, for it takes deep courage and conviction, a great vision, lots of hard work, various obstacles to over-ride, ( given the fact you are of ethnic origin in the United Kingdom) to inaugurate global companies. Take for example, the Pathak family. It was 40 years ago, that the family arrived in England from Kenya, to escape the Mau Mau terror attacks. They only had £5 pounds with them. The son Mr. Kirit Pathak recollects that he helped his father and mother to sell pakoras, bhajis and eventually chutneys, pickles and samosas to Indian expatriates from the kitchen of their North London home. It is extraordinary to note that now Mr. Kirit and his wife Meena have transformed the operation into an international business with an estimated turnover of more than £50 million a year. Their products are exported to more than 40 countries.
 <br> <br>
Please allow me to tell you a few more stories. The Croydon Guardian reported on April 14th 2004, that nine of the United Kingdom’s richest Asian businessmen are based in Croydon. This is an area I am very familiar with. The nine Asian men have a combined fortune of £107.3 million pounds, with the richest entrepreneur Paran Chandrasekaran, chief executive of information security, Indici Salus, worth 25 million pounds and how about this story, The Sunday Times reported on April 11, 2004, about the meteoric rise of Lakshmi Mittal, who arrived in Britain about 10 years ago. He recently bought one of the most prestigious properties in Europe, near Kensington Palace Gardens. This property is worth more than 70 million pounds. Forbes ranks Lakshmi Mittal as one of Europe’s most powerful man. This summer 2004, he showed the French glittering classes how to organize a party. For it’s reported this dotting father spent £37 million pounds on his only daughter, Vanisha’s wedding. He hired a true-to- life palace in Paris for the occasion. The wedding invitation comprised 50 pages, bound in silver. The expert cooks were flown in from Bengal, India. The wedding festivities lasted 5 days. Apparently he is also in the process of becoming the head of the world’s biggest steel company. For he is negotiating to take over America’s International Steel Group. This takeover will make him to become Britain’s richest man, worth about 12 billion pounds. In 2004 he also paid himself a 2 billion dollar dividend !!!
 <br> <br>
I am very aware that most of the names I mentioned above might not fully comprehend the context of the verses; I started my daily reading with, for they might not be believers in Christ Jesus but I still want to salute them for their extraordinary achievements. Herein I must quickly include one incredible Christian believer, an Asian Gentleman who is a candidate in the forthcoming elections to become a Mayor for London, England. Every blessing and success to Ram Gidoomal CBE, London Mayoral candidate for the Christian Peoples Alliance (CPA). Mr. Gidoomal has increased the Asian profile a hundredfold.
 <br> <br>
The good news is that I have moved on from the Civil Service to managing my own business now, Glory Be to God. 
<br> <br>
Oh, I need to relate this story to you. In the year 1978, through a series of circumstances I ended up praying for a multi- millionaire from Malaysia. He was in the private wing of King’s College, Hospital, London. He and his wife made one particular request of me. To pray that God the Father will remove the fear of death: he was filled with fear to go through the process of death. Here was a man with loads of money but being ravaged with the most virulent form of liver cancer, the tumour was stony hard. The very day he was dying, I happened to be in the room. I asked his wife, was there any prayer she wanted me to pray. Her reply was, Anton, God has already answered our prayer, for the fear of dying has gone, for there was a peaceful disposition on his face. Matthew Chapter 6 verse 33: 33But seek (aim at and strive after) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness (His way of doing and being right), and then all these things taken together will be given you besides.
<br> <br>
I remember once Saida (picture far below) sharing with me that on one occasion she was prompted by The Holy Spirit to share the below mentioned scripture with a close member of her family.   
<br> <br> 
   <font style="background-color: #FEF1B5"> 
   <b> Matthew 25 verses 12-13 </b> <br>
   So Stay Awake, Because You Do Not Know Either The Time Or The Hour
 </font> <br> <br>
The photograph below shows some members  of Saida's  family. This photo was taken in 1991.

 <br> <br>
It was in this ward , (pictured below) on 1st July 1997 she fainted suffering with
intense and agonizing pain.
