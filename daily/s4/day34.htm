<p><i>A)</i><i>
<u>Isaiah 10 verse 27</u> </i></p>
<p>In reference to Anointing.</p>

<p><i>It shall come to pass in that day that his </i></p><i>
( the 
devil�s ) </i><i>
burden will be taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your back. And 
his yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.</i>

must always manifest joy</span></p>

<p><i>In thy Presence is </i></p><i>
<u>fullness of joy</u></i><i>, 
at thy right hand there are pleasure for evermore. </i>

<p>
<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">The prophets are 
telling us that we are about to see the greatest outpouring of God�s power this 
earth has ever known. It�s been said that if we were told all that�s about to 
happen the world would not be able to grasp or comprehend or believe it, because 
the magnitude of the outpouring is so great. Glory Be to God.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Are we ready and prepared? Are we on the starting line, ready to respond 
immediately the minute God The Holy Ghost conveys His Commencement orders!!!!!!

<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">August 2004.</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> 
They practised, practised and practised to become champions in their specialised 
events, some of them for more than four years, making incredible amount of 
sacrifices. I heard some of them saying that they have not seen their families

<p><b>
<span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">How long have we been practising, 
The Presence of God in our lives, how long have we been waiting, meditating, 
praying, hearing, listening to the sensitive voice of God The Holy Ghost. Have

coming, can He depend on us?</span></b></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span lang="en-gb">d) </span>I heard this story related by Pastor Chuck Smith.</p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"> </span>When a barn burnt to the ground and the farmer walked across the charred 
remains and <span lang="en-gb">   </span>kicked what he thought was just burning embers and out from that 
ball of smoking embers <span lang="en-gb">  </span>fluttered a hen full of chicks and he looked closer and 
he saw it was a mother hen who had <span lang="en-gb"> </span>pulled her chicks beneath her to protect 
them. She died giving them life. Pastor Chuck Smith <span lang="en-gb"> </span>comments, I think of that 
when Jesus said, I would have gathered you as a hen gathers her 
<span lang="en-gb"> </span>nest but you 
would not, you wouldn�t let it happen.</p>

<b>
<p>I have written that 
Affliction 
produces obedience to God�s Word. </p>
<p></p>

<p><i><u>Psalm 119</u></i></p></b><i><u><br/>
</u></i><sup><b><i>67) Before I was afflicted I went astray, <br/>
But now I keep Your word. </i></b>
</sup>
<p>Let�s read another translation, of the same verse: Before my trouble I went 
wrong, but now I do thy bidding.</p>
<p>I would also like to paste here another translation of the 
above verse: </p>
<p></p>

<p></p><u><i>Psalm 119</i><br/>
</u><sup>67) </sup>Before I was afflicted I went astray, 
but now <b>Your word 
do I keep </b>[<b>hearing,
receiving, loving,
and obeying it</b>].

<p>Luke 15 verse 17</p>

senses, he went back home and his father declared in verse 
2<span lang="en-gb">3, "</span> let us revel and feast and be happy and merry,<span lang="en-gb">"</span>
