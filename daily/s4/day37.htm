<h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the You Tube video below.</h2> 
		<p>On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
		 Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
		 In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
    “Lead Kindly Light”.
     <br>
     <br>

<h2>The Hymn below, Lead Kindly Light radiates a Heavenly fragrance. A love song dispatched to Heaven!</b></h2> 
<h2><b>Prayer meetings of this nature are mandatory.</b></h2>

Dr. Selwyn Hughes response to my daily reading! 
<br>
Received 01 April 2005 12:57
<br> <i>
I have read this and was flattered. And blessed. I wish it were all true.
<br>
Selwyn </i>
<br><br>
Anton’s response and forwarding comments
<br><br>
   <i>
   Dear Bridget,
<br><br>
Sincerely thank you for forwarding Selwyn’s comments. I was proved right yet again.
<br><br>
Selwyn’s humble comments to me evidences to all my thoughts mentioned in this above daily reading. The man of God will always tell me to stay humble in Christ Jesus. Only exalt Our Lord Jesus Christ! Master and Saviour. 
<br><br> 
<b> 2 Corinthians 10:17-18 </b>
<br> <span class="highlight">
But, “Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.” For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. </span>
<br><br>
I thank God that it was our Lord that introduced Selwyn to me. I was born in Malaysia and I am aware that Selwyn has got an affection for Malaysia. He did tell me a story about how a Doctor in Malaysia ... </i>
<br><br>
I love to learn the dynamics, that is, “Spiritual Revelations,” of the Word of God from mature Men and Women of God. When I refer to mature, I am referring to individuals who have practised and been obedient to God’s Word and have been through unimaginable spiritual warfare and still come through shining as Champions for God. A Champion is someone who has overcome all forms of obstacles and been through the "fire" and still rejoicing in our Lord Jesus Christ. There is one particular individual I have been following quite closely ever since my arrival in the United Kingdom in 1973. His name is Selwyn Hughes. He was born on the 27th of April 1928 in the town of Dowlais, within the county of Glamorganshire, South Wales.
<br><br>
Although I came to the United Kingdom to study Banking and Finance and instead of becoming a specialist in this area, I must confess that I spent, (probably invested) a lot of man hours reading and meditating, (overtime) Selwyn’s little booklets called, Every Day with Jesus, like a fanatic-----similar to someone who will read their football magazines or their Pop Idol magazines. Apparently the book, Every Day with Jesus, is reaching 500,000 people in 150 countries. Praise the Living God.
<br><br>
I love this man, for when he speaks about Revival, he talks from a perspective as though he has seen and touched Revival. I love him even more for the fact that he oozes profound humility---- a vital characteristic seen in our Lord Jesus. From my angle I will hazard a guess by saying that sometime during the last ten years this humility has become very, very pronounced. Has God The Holy Ghost softened him through the sufferings he has gone through and  honoured him by baptising him with an overflowing spirit of humility? !!!!!!! I will certainly pray that every individual involved in the ministry will emulate this man’s humility. The first candidate to learn this aspect of humility will be yours truly, Anton.
<br><br>
 <b> James 3:13 </b>
<br><span class="highlight">
Who is there among you who is wise and intelligent?
<br>
 Then let him by his noble living show forth his [good] works with the [unobtrusive] humility [which is the proper attribute] of true wisdom.<br>
There are so many spiritual nuggets that I can share about Selwyn Hughes, but there is one which stands above them all, and that is to do with Biblical meditation, which he shares regularly with the 500,000 people worldwide. Here goes, How does one get the best spiritual revelation from the Bible? There are many of you who might think that you get the best revelation by reading and memorising chunks of the Bible. Although it’s true one might get some benefit from this process but you will get your richest and most fruitful benefit from practising this habit, that is to take a particular phrase, verse or passage and solely meditating on it till the Power contained within these verses saturate and penetrate your spirit, soul, body and mind. For a case example, please read my below mentioned Daily Reading. Something awesome happened to me when I practised this form of meditation.    
<br><br>
Thank You for this Selwyn.

<b>
Psalm 1 </b>
<br>
   1) Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked

    or stand in the way of sinners

    or sit in the seat of mockers.
<br>
2) But his delight is in the law of the LORD,

    and on his law he meditates day and night.
<br>
3) He is like a tree planted by streams of water,

    which yields its fruit in season

    and whose leaf does not wither.

    Whatever he does prospers.</span>
<br><br>
  In May 1998, as a family, we decided to go and participate in Selwyn Hughes’s 70th birthday celebration. The Master of Ceremonies was Pastor Gerald Coates from Horsham, Surrey. He is one of the founders of the Pioneer churches. It was held in a marquee in Farnham, Surrey. After a very wonderful celebration we decided to go and speak to Selwyn Hughes himself. It was so good to note that this Internationally known Pastor welcomed us very well. Given the nature of the man, he went on to encourage us, always inspiring and a joy to talk to. He is a sweet fragrance to the Body of Christ.. He took note that my wife Saida was born in Kampala, Uganda. Without a moments hesitation and with a cheerful disposition he shared with us that the wife of the President of Uganda, Mrs. Janet Museveni, reads Every Day with Jesus and she reads it each day. We also thank God for President Yoweri K Museveni.  May the Lord’s favour be upon him!
<br><br>
<b> Jeremiah 17:7-8 </b>
<br><span class="highlight">
"But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD ,

    whose confidence is in him.
<br>
He will be like a tree planted by the water

    that sends out its roots by the stream.

    It does not fear when heat comes;

    its leaves are always green.

    It has no worries in a year of drought

    and never fails to bear fruit." </span>
<br><br>
                Both our children did read the offshoots of the Selwyn Hughes Ministry. They read the following periodicals quite regularly, YPS and TOPZ. These booklets definitely gave them spiritual insights and understanding. Any material that helped our children in their spiritual formation we welcomed into our home. To this end we thank our friend Valerie Meilton for faithfully purchasing these bi-monthly periodicals. Thanks Be To Living God!

            <h2>Flag Counter</h2>
            <p>
                The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><i><b>8th January 2014.</b></i></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business. As a result we lost all our treasured statistics.<br>
                We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm. It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth!<br><br>

                This photo shows Jannine kneeling before the Master of St John's College, Professor C.M. Dobson, whilst he says these words:<br><br>
                <span class="highlight">"Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti."</span><br><br>

                It was my father's Dad, B. P. Nicholas between the years of 1918–1920, who commenced his first monetary business providing financial services in Ipoh, Perak, Malaya.
