		<p class="main">A recollection of our activity on Good Friday in London, England. 22nd April 2011.
     <br> <br>
     After attending our very vibrant All Peckham Good Friday service at the Baptist Church we decided for the first time to witness a live performance of The Passion of Jesus performed freely to the public in Trafalgar Square on 22 April 2011.Two performances were held, one at 12 noon and the other at 3-15 pm. There was a very big screen and wonderful acoustics. Our summary is that it was magnificently performed and very moving.What a delight to see the very Bishop of London himself giving the final benediction. Well done Dr. Richard John Chartres.<br> <br> <b>The Directors have given a provosional promise to perform this extraordinary play every year. So this year 2015 they will be performing twice on this world famous stage, Trafalgar Square.This will be on Good Friday 3rd April 2015 at the same times 12 noon and 15-15 pm. We exhort you not to miss it! We need to remind you that this performance contains a realistic interpretation of the crucifixion - so parental guidance is advised.The children will see a 'man' on the cross.</b>
<br> <br> 
<b> Just one suggestion. It would have been a sheer blessing, if we could have concluded the anointed drama with the LORDS PRAYER- THE OUR FATHER. </b>
 <br> <br>
Incidentally let us intensely pray for the current Bishop of London the Right Reverend Richard Chartres. He will be presenting the address, (the sermon) at the Royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. It is forecasted that a global audience of 2 billion people will watch this marriage ceremony. Much more than the one billion who watched the twenty/ twenty cricket final between India and Sri Lanka on Saturday 2nd April 2011. We pray the anointing of the Holy Ghost, the precious Presence of Jesus Christ, (The Anointed One) will rest strongly on the Rt. Honourable Dr. Richard John Carew Chartres and that every single word he proclaims during the address will touch the inner spirit of each global individual who is watching the live telecast from Westminster Abbey on Friday 29 April 2011. May it be so Father God.

    <h2>Good Friday 2014</h2> 
		<p class="main">
		<b>
		Thank God for what happened on that very special Good Friday, 2000 years ago :for this makes all the other days on the face of this earth worth living for. Oh, thank you so much Precious Saviour!

Oh, what more can we do Our Lord and our God to recompense your total sacrifice?</b>
<br> <br>
    And you completed the fullness of our joy by blasting the stench of death . The third day was resurrection ---we call it, proclaim it, declare it Easter Sunday.
<br> <br>
For once and for all you, Our Lord Jesus, conquered the fear of death. Death can never hold any sway over us! Our greatest desire is for the world to understand that the cross saved us from total damnation.
<br> <br>
  <b> On 3rd April 2015 the Church will reflectively remember Good Friday but Sunday is coming--Resurrection Day - Jesus is Alive. A morning of unimaginable joy. </b>

		<h2>Good Friday March through London </h2> 
		
		<p class="main">
		We as a family went to a morning service which was held at one of our sister churches. The Church was packed with enthusiastic worshippers all coming to pray and meditate on the crucifixion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br> <br>
Most of the local Churches in Peckham, South London came together in unity for a combined Good Friday Service at this centrally located Church, the Rye Lane ( Baptist Chapel) . We need to say that the Reverend Dr. Edward Frank Govei, the Pastor of the Baptist Chapel co-ordinated the service superbly.
<br> <br>
At the end of the service we assembled at Peckham Square with other local Christians. After a time of prayer and praise about 300 to 400 of us set off to do a prayer walk to St. Paul’s Cathedral in the City of London. St. Paul’s Cathedral is a prestigious building which was designed by Sir Christopher Wren.
<br> <br>
As we sang and walked, residents looked out from their apartments. A cross was carried while others held banners and flags. The people walking along and the passengers sitting on numerous buses had no option then to observe us for we were shouting and proclaiming the high praises of God. A trumpet and a drum added a lively accompaniment to our singing.
<br> <br>
As we walked through the large housing estates, we prayed for the families and we strongly interceded against gun, knife crime and gang culture. For at least 7 youngsters have very sadly either been gunned down or stabbed to death just in this local area.
<br> <br>
We paused for a small service in Burgess Park (our praise and worship team arrived by van with a generator!). As we continued our journey to the City, where all the worlds financial wheeling and dealing takes place, we prayed for hospitals, transport, local Churches and politicians. We also prayed against the sin of promiscuity for the young people, drugs, violence and the hopelessness in peoples’ lives.
<br> <br>
We also made sure we said a prayer for our son Paul, for we passed by his work place.
<br> <br>
It saddened us, ( yet it gave us a timely opportunity to pray) to pass a long queue of people including children wanting to enter the tourist site, the London Dungeon. Outside the dungeon were men and women dressed in brown hooded capes with faces painted in a grey / white (resembling death). All these people looked confused and uneasy when they saw us, not knowing quite how to respond. One of the frightening looking masked man actually acknowledged and smiled at Saida. There was also a very tall “monster” dressed up like a marauding dragon parading around the people.
<br> <br>
We prayed that the powerful Easter Message would touch them and some of the team tried to engage the hundreds of people waiting to enter this frightening and very dark London Dungeon. At this juncture we were very impressed by our Pastor, Reverend Frog Orr- Ewing. For he took control of the loud hailer and explained to the assembled crowd there why we were marching and invited all of them to attend a Church service on Easter Sunday to find out why Easter Sunday is a very joyful occasion for all Christians. We believe that Rev. Frog was one of the main organizers for this whole march. A couple of people did comment that they organized the route to perfection.
<br> <br>
As we crossed the now famous Millennium Bridge over the River Thames we could see St. Paul’s ahead of us. For the first steps on the bridge Saida had to hold Valerie’s hand tightly, the reason being for years Valerie Meilton had a tremendous fear for crossing bridges. For the foul devil used to lie to her that some force was going to carry her and throw her over the bridge. We thank God for the victory God the Father gave her for walking on this long bridge. This was a very brave act for Valerie. Considering everything it was a bold move she made. Certain fresh incidences must have come back to her memory. For example on the 1st of August 2007 an eight - lane freeway bridge in Minneapolis, USA ,collapsed into the Mississippi River. About 5 people, a marketing Director, an exercise therapist, a produce salesman, a cosmetology student and a truck driver very sadly died and 79 others were injured.
<br> <br>
The London Millennium Bridge is the first pedestrian river crossing over the Thames in central London for more than 100 years. It’s 330 meters long (0.205miles ) linking the City of London and St. Paul’s Cathedral with the Tate Modern Gallery at Bankside. For Valerie it looked like the bridge was about 5 miles long.The bridge was officially opened on 10 June 2000 when an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people crossed it. It’s a fact that all bridges move to some degree. When the structural engineers observed the large groups of people crossing, they saw larger than expected sideways movements occurring. The bridge had to be closed for investigations on 12th June. There is a video footage demonstrating the movement of the bridge which might worry most people especially someone like Valerie. The engineers referred to the fault as Synchronous Lateral Excitation and other bridge designers have been warned of this phenomenon. The bridge we were walking on cost £18 million pounds to build.
<br> <br>
After we went across the River Thames we arrived at St. Paul’s, after about a four mile walk (6 ½ km). We had a final praise and worship victorious service with some added testimonies on the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral. After the service was over and as we were on our way back, the heavens opened  for some painful heavy hail stones came crashing down. There was also some spectacular lightning on display. Just a tiny glimpse of something similar that happened on that Good Friday 2000 years ago after our Precious Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ died on that sacred cross.
<br> <br>
We happened to be listening to Premier Christian Radio on 25th July 2009. It was a programme called Best Seller presented by Patrick Woodward. He is the Director of Programmes for Revival Media. Each week he interviews a Bible teacher to expound on some of the bible verses. During that week the expounder was the Reverend Geoffrey Smith, who currently is the Director of Christian Friends of Israel- UK. We used to know Geoffrey and his wife Margaret whilst he was the Administrator at St. Mark’s Church, Kennington, London.
<br> <br>
Geoffrey gave a revelation on the biblical verses found in:
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
John 19 verses 28-30
<br> <i>
28) Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty." 29) A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus' lips. 30) When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
</font> </i>
<br> <br>
Geoffrey was explaining that the soldier used his personal toilet kit a sponge to offer the wine vinegar to Jesus. This sponge was part of the same kit the soldier would have used to clean himself. For the Romans had 'flushing toilets' which were actually channels of water. They used theses sponges which were on sticks to clean themselves.
<br> <br>
When Jesus cried out, “It is Finished,” this embodied that Jesus went to the utmost degradation and humiliation for us that a personal toilet sponge was used to offer a drink to our Lord Jesus.

	<h2>Wedding<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">
    -It will fascinate you to watch this wedding video of Anton &amp; Saida.</font></h2> 
		</font>
    <FONT style="background-color:#FFFFFF">
		<p class="main">
		
		&nbsp;Anton was an orthodox, ultra-conservative, devout Roman Catholic, 
        attending daily Mass. He came from a very true-blue Roman Catholic family and receiving daily 
        Communion was very significant.
        <br> <br>
        Whereas Saida was a thoroughbred born- again evangelical Christian, an 
        evangelist drawing people to Jesus, who could not understand the concept 
        that a Roman Catholic can experience a spiritual rebirth too.
        <br> <br>
        The answer lies in the vision.<br>
        It was a three dimensional open vision in which our Lord Jesus appeared 
        twice to Anton and showed him the whole marriage scene and the 
        individuals involved.<br>
        Thereby divinely mandating Anton to marry Saida.<br>
        (For he needed this powerful personal visitation to marry a non 
        -Catholic-for he had an unswerving loyalty to the Catholic Church).</font><FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"><br>

		We were at the Millwall football stadium ( new Den) last Sunday, 11th May 2008 for the London Global Day of Prayer. What blessed us the most was that Boris Johnson, the recently elected London Mayor actually graced us with his presence at the stadium. When he asked us to pray for him, he was visibly shaken when all 19,000 of us got up immediately and stretched our hands towards him and prayed and interceded for him. I don’t think London Mayor Boris has seen such a prayerful gathering before. I think I am right in saying that the former Mayor Ken Livingstone would not have come to a Christian gathering such as Global Day of Prayer. Our daily prayer now is that Boris’s wife Marina Johnson, a barrister by profession would be encouraged and drawn by the Holy Spirit to attend an Alpha course. We are inviting all Christians to pray for this to come to pass.
