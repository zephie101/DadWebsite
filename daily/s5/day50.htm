Sad news that an extraordinary Christian inspirational speaker <b>Dr. Myles Munroe</b> tragically died in a plane crash, 9th November 2014 in Nassau,Bahamas. Among the passengers who also died was his dear wife Ruth Ann Munroe. They were enroute to Freeport Grand Bahamas to attend his own Leadership Conference.One of Dr. Munroe's special theme/topic was how to establish the principles of the 'Kingdom of God' on the face of this earth. Some well-known business leaders around that region were expected to attend.We are prayerfully digesting this sorrowful news.<br> <br>

Farewell for now, Our Dear Friend, Dr.Tayo Adeyemi until we meet again.<br> <br>We were privileged to attend the funeral service for Dr Tayo. We got up very early in the morning (23rd August 2013),to show our respect for this anointed man of God. We passed by his body, lying in state, and said a prayer of blessing. We must say that the whole service was very well conducted. We heard snippets of sermons and heavenly gems utterd by Dr Tayo. The ushers were gracious and kind. It was a lovely touch that transport was provided by New Wine ministries between the venues.The reception after the service was well organised. This service will be remembered by us for a long time to come. We were also given a treasured item, a beautifully presented magazine, titled,'A Celebratory Tribute to Dr Tayo Adeyemi 1964 -2013.' You will be able to read important details and highlights of Dr Tayo's life within these 55 pages. Get the magazine and trust us you will treasure it! <br> <br> There was an impressive line-up of well-known Christian leaders and Pastors attending the funeral service which indicated the prestigious and honourable position that Dr. Tayo held on the international scene. Some of them were called to the stage to pray, prophecy and anoint the newly appointed Senior Pastor for New Wine Church, Greenwich. He is Pastor Michael Olawore.<br> <br>The Pastoral Roll of Honour included Bishop Francis Wale Oke (The Vice President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria), Pastor Randy Morrison from Speak The Word Church in Minnesota, USA,  Dr Creflo Dollar of World Changers International, College Park, Atlanta, Georgia,  Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo of Kingsway International Christian Centre-Prayer City in  Chatham, Kent,  Bishop John Francis of Ruach City Church, Brixton Hill, Brixton,  Pastor Sam Adeyemi of Afatha Ministries- Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Lagos, Nigeria,  Pastor Hugh Osgood - Senior Minister of Cornerstone Christian Centre, The Mall, Bromley, Kent, Dr John Solomon of Miracle Ministry International, Chennai, India and  Bishop Joseph Garlington of Covenant Church, Pittsburgh, USA.<br> <br> <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> <b>In India Dr Tayo sponsored a Lepers Colony in the suburbs of Chennai City. Nearly a 100 people with leprosy were housed and looked after tenderly.Dr Tayo insisted in calling this refuge centre as "Shalom Town".<br> <br>(31 countries in the world are reporting cases of leprosy. For the past 50 years, the last Sunday in January is remembered as Leprosy Day. Thousand’s throughout the globe are asked to stop and reflect on those who are suffering with this dreadful disease.) </span></b> </b> <br> <br> One must also give credit to Muyiwa Olarewaju, who is linked to London Christian Premier Radio, for doing a splendid job as Master of Ceremonies.<br> <br>
<b> <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> An unusual happening:  A testimony worth reading.</span></b> </b>
The reception was held in a marquee located near the Royal Artillery Barracks, Repository Road, Woolwich after the funeral service. Some delicious snacks were laid out for us. It was a generous feast and there was abundant food for every individual to enjoy. I must say everything done at New Wine Church brought forth the fruit of Dr Tayo’s teaching that is <b> <b><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">  ‘ Whatever you do in life do it excellently ’.</span></b> </b> <br> <br>

<b> <b><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> What happened next was exemplary.</span></b> </b> <br> Neither my family nor I realised just how far this spirit of excellence would manifest itself. For in one gallant moment we saw the real, genuine and authentic spirit of Dr. Tayo that has been etched on the members of the congregation. As we were leaving the barracks compound we met some members of the church who were manning the car park. We realised we had to walk back to the nearest railway station to get home. As this kind individual was showing us the route that we ought to take to get to the station someone standing behind us, a total stranger, overheard our conversation. Spontaneously he spoke to us and said, “Look I will ask my family just to stay here whilst I will give you a lift to the station.” This offer went beyond the line of duty. It was an extra ordinary act of love. He invited us to come into his car and dropped us near the station. We want to say to you Dr. Frank that your act of love showed us the true spirit of Dr. Tayo. All his valuable teachings came forth in a practical way. These acts are rare events. Well done Dr. Tayo. May your fruit be long lasting!<br> <br> <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">Just before we left Greenwich we decided to observe the surroundings and to have cup of tea and a scone at a local shop. As we sat we sensed that there was a tremendous atmospheric change in the spiritual realm located around the area surrounding the premises of the New Wine Church. Most of the people we passed, managed to catch a smile from, or spoke to were pleasant and exuded a nice spirit. This was especially so of those who originally came from West Africa. It was then that we realised that all the prayers, supplications, intercessions and groaning in the Holy Spirit actually have affected the spiritual atmosphere in Greenwich and brought in a Godly influence. This constant strategic prayer from the New Wine church has made a significant impact in the area. Glory be to God for anointed prayer definitely changes the atmosphere and brings a smile to the heart of our Heavenly Father. </span></b> </b><br> <br>

Incidentally it is pertinent that we need to mention this sad news here that it was near these barracks,(Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, Southeast London) that a British Army Drummer, Private Lee Rigby, of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was attacked and killed by two men on the afternoon of 22nd May 2013. This horrible murder impacted the whole of the United Kingdom. It is just incredible that a few months later Greenwich witnessed a grand funeral of Pastor Tayo. The spiritual atmosphere at the funeral helped in the healing process.<br> <br>
This current move of our Precious Holy Spirit would have excited Pastor Tayo's tender spirit. He would have loved to be involved with this 
2013 outpouring.Given the fact that he has ministered in South East Asia.Pastor Tayo would have been thrilled to know that a Pastor from Singapore,Yang Tuck Yoong, Senior Pastor of Cornerstone Community Church has invested financially and spiritually in this historical revival site:<a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/daily/s6/day57.htm"><font color="#000000">

He was a great exhorter of the Word of God, preaching and teaching with genuine fervency. In his 48 years he has actually done more than many others in their given life span to promote and expand the Kingdom of God especially in the United Kingdom.<br> <br> It was during this same period that we also attended two other churches where the Pastors were also feeding us spiritual gems and uplifting sermons. Merit is also given to the Praise and Worship teams who were splendid in drawing in the Presence of the Holy Spirit. These other churches were Trinity Baptist Church, West Norwood, led by Pastor Kingsley Appiagyei and Kingsway International Christian Centre where the Pastor is Reverend Matthew Ashimolowo.<br> <br>

After preaching the anointed Word, Anton laid hands and prayed for the people in need. We were grateful for the Presence of The Holy Ghost. Do watch the video and we pray as you are viewing that the healing power of the cross of Jesus will touch you personally.

For over 13 years Dad (Anton) faithfully prayed and spoke the Word of our Lord aloud (the verses of the bible) every day, together with Jannine. Dad coached her on how to articulate the biblical verses, oozing and speaking them, percolated with the sweet fragrance of the Holy Spirit. To discern whether Dad has done a successful job, do hear a short rendition of her public reading at All Saints Church, Peckham on 19 July 2009 at the 10 am service:

Oh! It was so exciting to hear live on Christian Premier Radio, on 23rd December 2008 that a thriving and lively church in South London was giving out 2,300 Christmas food hampers as gifts to the needy in the area. It was so very appropriate that during this period of economic crisis, and credit crunch that this church was doing this kind, Godly deed. The Church is led by the Senior Pastor Dr. Tayo Adeyemi of New Wine Church, Gateway House, John Wilson Street, SE 18. They also placed an advertisement in their local paper called The Mercury. I actually heard a local man saying that he read this in the papers and rang up the church office. Apparently people had to fill in a form to enable the Church to decipher and gauge who really were the needy in the area.
<br> <br>
 This loving action caught the attention of the local media and some dignitaries. These included the Mayor of the Borough Councillor Steve Offord, and the Member of Parliament for the area, The Right Honourable Nick Raynsford for the Constituency of Greenwich and Woolwich.
<br> <br>
I thought I heard a price of how much each hamper cost, something to the figure of £40-00 each. The items included various type of Cranbury sauces, mince pies, vegetables, jam bottle, wine, curry pickles, turkey, stuffing’s, potatoes, anointedChristmas pudding and various other goodies. So the total package must have cost the Church £92,000-000. Pastor Tayo also mentioned that most of the expenses for these gifts were met by the Church members. Glory be to God! About 500 church members volunteered to come and package the hampers.
<br> <br>
It being a very cold day whilst the local populace were queuing to partake of their packages, they were given mince pies, cookies and hot coffee to keep them warm.
<br> <br>
The thousands of commuters who passed this church (located in a main street being a former cinema but now transformed into a brand ultra modern Church) were transfixed and mesmerised by what was happening in front of this church. For they were curious to know why all those people were queuing up!!!
<br> <br>
Apparently before they got this idea they knocked at the doors of about 10,000 households, during a four week period to do a research of what the local needs were. They told the enquirers at the door that they wanted to come and serve them and in what appropriate manner could they do this. Through this they found out the needs of the families namely being: a) marriage counselling, b) bereavement counselling, c) employment/work needs and d) youth needs.
<br> <br>
I am only citing this story here as part of my daily reading for this Godly deed actually caught my attention. For this was not only a praying church but was also a giving church. Surely the love message behind this generous giving must impact the local community. Anointed love giving always attracts new members to the Church.----Let this be so for this New Wine Church!
<br> <br>
I was also further blessed to hear that other churches who are on fire for our Lord are following the fine gesture of this church. Apparently another congregation called Jesus House who meet at Brent Cross, North London gave out about 1800 hampers. This fellowship in North London is led by Pastor Agu. I sense I am observing a common feature that is that they are both interceding churches. They spend a considerable length of time praying, fasting and supplicating before our Lord’s Presence. Pastor Tayo told the radio audience that Jesus House was so impressed by the hamper giving of New Wine Church that they followed their example. Oh, Heavenly Father may more God inspired churches follow the examples of these two. The testimony is now that about two dozen Churches all over the United Kingdom are distributing Christmas hampers- the count now is about 6000 hampers-- may it grow to 600,000 hampers!!!!!
<br> <br>
I must also cite an incident that happened to me during the year 2007. I saw myself sitting in front of the computer witnessing and hearing a funeral service being streamed through the internet. The whole service took a few good hours. It was the funeral service of Pastor Ify Irukwu, wife of Pastor Agu who sadly died at a very young age. I have never met Pastor Agu, nor have I met his late precious wife. We have also never been to his Church. So why on earth was I glued to my computer to witness this funeral service. I must also record here that I happened to hear a brief news report on BBC Radio 4-- it was actually on the early morning BBC Radio 4's flagship current affairs programme called Today. The Religious Affairs presenter mentioned that a big funeral service was for the first time going to be held at the Wembley Arena where about 10,000 Christians were expected to pack this arena to celebrate the passing away of this influential woman pastor.
<br> <br>
Occasionally I have heard on the radio of various celebrities passing away, but nothing has moved my spirit like this particular news. Rarely the most popular Radio 4 programme ever mention items of this nature. I refer to all this news, although it was a sad item, as spiritual breakthroughs. Together with her husband Agu, she pastored the 2,000-strong Redeemed Christian Church of God (Jesus House) at Brent Cross in London. Its only some time later whilst talking to a local Pastor I came to the realization what motivated me to listen to a service of a total stranger. According to my Pastor friend this church, Jesus House is a very strong interceding church---this was the common denominator that linked my spirit to this church. I also found out that this church is under the mentorship of Reverend Enoch Adeboye who is the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. Incidentally, Newsweek ( a liberal magazine) credited Enoch Adeboye as one of the 50 most powerful people in the world. (January 5th 2009 periodical). The magazine cites that the sole mission of this Pentecostal preacher is to save souls. (Alleluia). Only two Christians made their impact in the top 50. The other Christian to grace this illustrious feature was the Pope, Benedict XVI.
<br> <br>
The Redeemed Christian Church of God is one of the fastest growing churches in London, (England) and Europe, with over 40,000 members in the capital alone. This can only occur through Christian love and much prayer.
<br> <br>
Now I know why I spent so many hours watching the whole funeral service of somebody I have never met.
<br> <br>

<h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the You Tube video below.</h2> 
		<p class="main">On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
		 Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
		 In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
    “Lead Kindly Light”.
