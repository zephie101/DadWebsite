On Saturday 28th December 1946 Mr Albert Arasaratnam Nicholas, the second son of the late Mr B. P. Nicholas, the founder of the Oriental Bank of Malaya Ltd., and of Mrs Ester Chellammah Nicholas led to the altar at the Church of St Anthony, Pandateruppu, Miss Theresa Jeyamani Veerasingham, eldest daughter of Mr J.

</figure>

       <p class="main">

 Revd. Father P.J.  Jeevaratnam O.M.I., an uncle of the bride sang the Nuptial High Mass assisted by Revd. P.T. Fathers James O.M.I. and Leo Thuraisingham O.M.I.  The Choristers of the church sang selected hymns with Reverend Fr. L. J. Augustine O.M.I. presiding at the organ.<br> <br> Fr Augustine preached an instructive homily on the holy state of matrimony.  The attending witnesses were Benedict Ponniah Esq., C.C.S., a cousin of the bridegroom and F.A. Sandrasegra Esq., Asst. Registrar at Co-operative Societies, Jaffna.<br> <br>

The bridesmaids were Misses Alageswari Singanayagam and Beatrice Veerasingham while Misses Anna Joseph and Sylvie Pedropillai acted as flower girls. The bridegroom was supported by Mr Anton Joseph Veerasingham as his best-man and   Master Damian formed the role of a charming little page-boy.<br> <br> The bride was attired in silver brocade and carried a bouquet of madona lilies. Her going away saree was one of gold tissue.<br> <br>

After the ceremony in the church, a neatly arranged reception was held in the residence of the parents of the bride.  Mr F. A. Sandrasegra proposed the toast in a short humorous speech followed by Revd. Brother Innasimuttu S.S.J.

On the 30th December Mrs B.P. Nicholas held a social at the Bank House, Chapel Street, Jaffna.  Guests flocked in large numbers and Malayan friends from all parts of the Jaffna Peninsula graced the occasion with their presence.<br> <br>  The Bank House was tastefully decorated with fresh flowers and greenery. Refreshments were lavishly served.  The social ended late in the night with the customary dinner to numerous relatives and closest friends of the family.  May all prosperity attend the new couple.

The picture below is of the Church where my dear Mum and I attended daily services, at Our Lady of Lourdes Klang: No. 114, Jalan Tengku Kelana, Klang, Selangor, Malaysia. I received much spiritual nurturing within these premises. Our whole family worshipped there on Sunday mornings.

<br> <br>

I was a daily communicant, attended Saturday Novenas, and Stations of the Cross. There was also a grotto at the Klang Church that resembled Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto in France, which is located on the south-western part of the Hautes-Pyrenees.

        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is

        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 

        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 

        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.

        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>

        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.

        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> The conditions are steep for Jannine </b> </a>

         she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
