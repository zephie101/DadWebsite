  When the riots first began in Hackney, East London, Father Wickham at 4 pm took the challenge and came out onto the streets wearing his dog collar and cassock. He was accompanied by the Bishop of Stepney, the very Reverend Adrian Newman, who was the former Dean of Rochester. They were praying through the riot areas and then a little later on in the evening they proceeded to Clarence Road where some serious rioting was taking place.  The looting was just beginning at that point. <br> <br>
They saw a woman in her seventies who had collapsed on the street with a broken hip and the riot police had formed a little guard around her. People were continuing to throw rocks at the police even though there was a very injured woman just behind.  The police said to Father Wickham and Bishop Adrian “Look, they’re not listening to us, can you go and ask them please to stop throwing things”.  So they made their way from where that incident took place and walked up the street and spoke to any group of people of which there were many. They said “Look, it’s time to calm down a little bit. Let’s wait for the ambulance, and let the ambulance take this woman away”.  So they stopped throwing stones to let the ambulance in and the police disappeared.  And then it was back to the looting and it just carried on and Father Wickham stayed bravely, praying on the streets till about midnight.
