<h2>Did you know about the favour of our Lord on this College in Wales? The Former Rees Howell's Bible College Of Wales, Swansea.</h2> 

<p class="main">
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC" size="5">
<b> James 5:16 (Amplified Bible) </b>
The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].
<br> <br>
<b> James 5:16 (New Century Version) </b>
 16) When a believing person prays, great things happen.</b>
<br> <br></font>
A friend of ours <b>Revd. Pastor Robin Rees,</b> who previously hosted a daily one hour talk show on The Gospel Channel on Christian Television, sent me excellent news about the stirring of the Holy Spirit in Swansea, Wales. Pastor Rees was also the Director for the UK and European region of The Full Gospel Fellowship of Churches and Ministers International whose headquarters are in Dallas. We also know his wife Elsa.<br> <br>
<b>Our Dear Pastor Robin Rees passed away into our Lord's Glory on 13th July 2020 at 5-30 am. Thank God some family members were with him in the Hospital. Elsa reported that whilst she was holding Robin's hand at times he was squeezing her hand. What a tender farewell.<br> <br> His farewell service is on 30th July, 2020 in Swansea, Wales. We will be watching the whole service on Zoom. Due to the Coronavirus lockdown guidelines only a very limited number can attend the funeral.</b> <br> <br>
Here below is what I wrote to my friends in the Fellowship about how much Robin Rees impacted me.<br><br>
"The Fellowship, the Body of Christ did take up the battle.
We fought a bold good fight for the life of Robin Rees. 
<br> <br>
Thank you indeed Pastor Hendrick Bruce. You were the vanguard. You organised the Prayer Brigade. Held precious Communion.<br> <br>
We say thank you to Bishop Simon Iheanacho. On a number of occasions I have heard you praying on television. I touch the rewind button numerous times just to hear your powerful prayer again.
You must have pounded the Court Room of Heaven regarding Robin Rees.
In one of the last conversations I had with Robin he requested me to link up with you. I am thankful I have done so.<br> <br>
We thank the Lord that we are very assured where he has gone to now.
Meanwhile we will carry on proclaiming the message of the Good News that Robin Rees shared with so many people.<br> <br>
For he was the one who shared the Good News with me.
When I went into his Pentecostal Church in Watford,  year 1976. (My devout and committed Roman Catholic mother would have given me a scolding if she knew what Church I attended). 
It was that powerful baritone Welsh voice of Robin that commissioned me to surrender my life completely to Jesus Christ my Lord & Saviour.
Thank you very much Pastor Robin Rees.
You made it. Victorious Warrior. You are with Jesus now."
<br> <br>
If you want to hear Robin's powerful Welsh baritone voice then you will be able to pick up that sound from the video below.
It was the Annual Conference held at the Bible College of Wales located in Swansea.
<br> <br>
It was Robin who introduced me to the Bible College of Wales. Also not forgetting the Moriah Chapel and Nicholaston House, Penmaen, Swansea.
Thank God. I will always treasure this below noted video.

<br> <br>
 Robin was the one who forwarded me information regarding the initial stages of reclaiming The Bible College of Wales. Apparently a Pastor associated with a church in Singapore has purchased this historical Bible College. The name Rees Howells still stirs praying intercessors all over the world for this prayer General is closely associated with this college in Wales.
<br> <br>
What an honour that our Almighty God anointed Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong from Singapore for this heavenly task. He is the founder and Senior Pastor of Cornerstone Community Church which is an independent Pentecostal congregation based in Singapore. <b>Surely blessing after blessing awaits this precious investment.</b> <br> <br>
One can sense how Rees Howell's very powerful intercessory prayers, spoken many years ago, could have resulted in a church in Singapore helping to preserve this bible college, thus retaining part of its historical perspective.<br><br>A Divine assignment occurred In September 2011.<b> Our Lord spoke a clear Word to a small team of Pastors led by Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong from Cornerstone Community Church in Singapore to visit South Wales. Their Heavenly task was to re-dig the revival wells where revival broke out in the 1900’s.Also to pray specifically for these consecrated areas.</b><br><br>
Like so many others who were captured and fascinated by the on-going revival in Wales, Pastor Yoong had read about Rees Howells in the book called ‘Intercessor.’ Interestingly our local Vicar Amanda Johnson and my wife Saida had also read this profoundly affecting book in their mid-twenties and still till today talk about the contents.<br> <br> Rees Howells trained his prayer team to travail in prayer at the Bible College and part of the fruit was to see Israel being birthed as a nation. 
The passion for revival seen through the lens of Rees Howells was impregnated within Pastor Yoong .Till today he is one of the visionaries longing for revival in Singapore.<br><br>

<h2> Cwmbran Victory Church. Greenforge Way,Springvale Ind Estate
Cwmbran NP44 3UZ.<br>Pastor Richard Taylor.</h2> 
<p class="main">
 There is another current revival story developing in Wales. It is catching our attention.
Apparently this stirring of the Spirit commenced around 10th April 2013 at a small mid- week meeting. 
 Pastor Richard preached a prophetic word from the book of Esther.He introduced the notion of bringing our enemy before the King similar to Esther bringing Haman to King Ahasuerus.<br><br> Pastor used this scripture reference as a visual image which we could apply to our modern day problems,like employment or health. He exhorted the congregation to seek the attention of the King.<br> <br>Some members of the congregation came forward for prayer and healing.
Testimonies came forth from this prayer gathering. Someone called Paul who had been in a wheelchair for about 10 years due to a car accident received prayer and God the Holy Spirit touched him. He miraculously got out of his wheelchair and as a sign of victory lifted his wheelchair above his head. A tremendous spirit of Faith enveloped the atmosphere and they sensed the lovely Presence of God.<br> <br> From this day onwards they kept the Church open.The Pastor reports that apart from normal church service on Sundays, they have had outpouring meetings every night.This outpouring has attracted thousands of visitors from all over the world. Some figures suggest 9,000 visitors.The church has 42 planned baptisms. In total they have baptised 67 people.</b>

<b>A precursor to the events that are definitely unfolding and how to prepare spiritually for the soon coming year 2021.</b>
<br> <br>
The Global World has never experienced or seen in this generation a Lockdown of such severity.
<br> <br>
<u><b> Psalm 91</u></b> is a protective covering so read the verses passionately. The powerful verses are found near the end of the video below.

<br>
<b>Repentance is mandatory.</b>
<br> 
Please do not miss the opportunity in case it passes you by.
<br><br>
The lifesaving answer is within this video.
<br> <br>
Place your name within the Lamb's Book of Life.

<h2>A Reverential, deeply moving Prayer Vigil. Watch the You Tube video below.</h2> 
		<p class="main">On Saturday 18th September 2010, we attended the much needed Prayer Vigil at Hyde Park, London.
		 Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park.
		 In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung,
    “Lead Kindly Light”.
