<h2> We are lifting up in prayer Pastor Kong Hee of City Harvest Church, Singapore.<br> <br> <b> Updated 10th April 2017.</b> We will continue to pray for you and your family as we are observing the warfare is intensifying.

<br><br>Interesting submissions by the Defence Lawyers on the case regarding Facts and Intent.</h2>

<h3>

In a blow to the prosecution the High Court has reduced the sentences of the six church leaders.<br><br> City Harvest Church's Pastor Kong Hee's eight-year jail term was reduced to three-and-a-half years and the others all had their sentences reduced.<br> <br> This was a result of the defence making a very well-reasoned case that the six church leaders should have been convicted of a less serious offence.<br> <br> 

There are various offences of criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code of Singapore.<br> <br> The six had originally been convicted of the most serious offence of criminal breach of trust, known as the s409 offence. Two of the three judges in the High Court found that the six did not fall within the meaning of "agent" under s409 and should instead have been convicted of the less serious offence of criminal breach of trust (the s406 offence).<br> <br> These judges also said that there were exceptional mitigating factors including the fact that the conspiracy involved no personal gain on the part of Pastor Kong and the other church leaders and they felt it was telling that a substantial proportion of the congregation continued to support Ms Ho Yeow Sun’s career even after the full facts were brought to light.<br> <br> 

By way of background, criminal breach of trust is when a person has been entrusted with property (in this case church funds) and they misappropriate that property. The s409 offence applies where there is a criminal breach of trust by a public servant, banker, merchant, broker, attorney or agent. The judges in the High Court found that the church leaders could not fall within s409 because their relationship with the church is internal. A criminal breach of trust in an external relationship, such as when a person offers his services to the community at large and makes a living from those services, may fall within the more serious s409 offence (and professional agent relationships certainly will fall within the offence).

<br> <br>Following this decision of the High Court, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam has said that the Attorney General's Chambers ("AGC") will be looking into the judgment as it considers that the decision of the High Court has significant implications beyond the current case, particularly around the meaning of "agent" in the s409 offence.<br> <br> The AGC has therefore made a Criminal Reference to the Court of Appeal. Criminal References are rare and only filed under exceptional circumstances where a party to a criminal proceeding wishes to refer a question of law or public interest. The AGC has said that if the Court of Appeal agrees with its submissions, the prosecution intends to ask the court to reinstate the original convictions under s409. The decision in a Criminal Reference is final.

Please pray mercy will be extended to one and all.<br> <br>

We thank God for the Judicial wisdom extended by Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin, Justice Chan Seng Oon and Justice Woo Bih Li. <br> <br>

Please pray that God’s Wisdom will manifest in this important case. Our prayer is that the promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Singapore will manifest itself powerfully soon.



<br> <br>The Republic of Singapore will be remembered in our daily intercession.</h3>

           <u><b> First observation in Reading. Evangelism breakthrough May 2016. </b></u><br> <br>



A report of an unprecedented openness to the Gospel in Reading, United Kingdom.<br> Over a 1000 people made a commitment to Christ. The Pastor was shocked at what happened on the first night. He has always believed that the Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation. He would not compromise on the Gospel that Jesus died for our sins and the Power of the Blood of the Risen Saviour. This is reminiscent of the powerful teaching of the late Derek Prince. I faithfully listen to Derek Prince teachings.<br> <br>



<u> <b>Please take note of this 'Glory Call.'</b></u> <br> <br> Pastor Yinka Oyekan first began by telling how he received an unusual call about the vision for a mission in Reading from the General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain, Lynne Green.<br> <br> She had received a vision the night before about a Glory Cloud over the country and she described it as beacons of fire which were about prayer. What she described is a Glory Cloud above the nation and this was hitting Reading first. This was hugely significant to the Pastor but also quite a surprise to him hearing from the head of the Baptist Union!



<br><br> We are also hearing incredible reports of what the Holy Spirit is doing in the Northern part of the United Kingdom. In one particular Church about 60 Iranians have become Christians and they are very involved in the Alpha Course. So the Holy Spirit is indeed stirring.



<br> <br> <b> Significantly the Reverend Jean Darnall prophesied this prophetic vision 49 years ago. The year was 1967. So we are entering the 50th Year now. The Year of the Jubilee



<br> <br> We know Jean Darnall for I graduated from her Bible School where her husband Elmar Darnall was the Principal.</b>

Praying for an outpouring of the Holy Ghost!<br><br>

May our Lord continue His outpouring of Divine Love and compassion on the nation of Singapore.

<br> <br> 

There is an important court case proceeding in Singapore regarding City Harvest Church.<br><br>

<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC"><i> <b> We actually visited Singapore in July 2015 whilst we were in Malaysia to celebrate our Dad's 100th year legacy. 

<a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/oriental.htm"><font color="#0000FF"> <b> Press here for an interesting read. The pioneering Nicholas family in Malaysia.They laid a foundation stone in Malaysia.</font></b></a> </b> </i> </font>

<br> <br>

Our last visit to Singapore was in 1995.Twenty years ago!<br> <br> <font style="background-color:#FFFFCC"><i> <b> 

Given the fact we were praying for this Church, ( City Harvest Church) we decided to make a flying visit after their Sunday morning service on 19th July 2015. We must place it on record that the welcoming team gave us a very loving and warm welcome and showed us around the church. We are deeply grateful.</b> </i>  </font> <br> <br>

<img class="main" src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/daily/CityHarvest1.JPG" width="400" height="300" alt="City Harvest 1">

<br> <br>

<img class="main" src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/daily/CityHarvest2.JPG" width="400" height="300" alt="City Harvest 2">

</span></font>

<br> <br>

One factor I am aware of, however, is that this church is being used mightily to revive the 

vibrant youth in Singapore drawing them closer to our Lord Jesus.Their missionary team have been instrumental in bringing forth an outpouring of The Holy Spirit in Taipeh, Taiwan.<br> <br>

The case concerns City Harvest Church and its founder Senior Pastor Kong Hee. The other members who are facing trial are Serina Wee Gek Yin, Chew Eng Han, Sharon Tan, Tan Ye Peng and John Lam.<br> <br>

It was relieving to note that Singapore's Commissioner of Charities has lifted 

the suspension order on Pastor Kong Hee’s wife, Sun Ho. This will allow her to 

resume her executive duties at the church.<br> <br>We will definitely pray for Pastor Kong Hee and his family.<br> <br>

<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">

  Some scriptural verses worth pondering on:<br> <br>

John Chapter 8 verse 7) On one occasion Our Dear Lord Jesus had one question:'-- He said to them, 'The one sinless among you, let him cast the first stone at her.' <br> <br>

Romans 3 verse 22 :'For there is no distinction among people, 23) since all have sinned and continue to fall short of God’s glory.'<br> <br>



<i> <b>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bpnicholasmalaysia/"> Our gracious response to some comments on the B P Nicholas Facebook.</font></b></a> </b> </i> </font>  <br> <br>

<font style="background-color:#F6CCDA">

A) We have just come back from Church and read your comment. Are we still mandated to pray for Pastor Kong Hee our brother in Christ? Is there a scriptural prescription that we still need to pray for our Brethren in ‘prison’ or out of ‘prison’ whatever the charges are?

<br> <br>

In the United Kingdom prisoners are under the care of Her Majesty’s Prison Service.<br>

Can we still continue to pray for Pastor Kong Hee and for a revival to break forth in Singapore? Thousands are faithfully praying for your nation Singapore.<br> <br> I love the comforting and gentle words of our Dear Lord Jesus: Matthew 25 verse 36

‘I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.'<br> <br>

Some say the law is the law. We still thank God for HIS GRACE. Even if an individual has committed a crime we still continue to pray and comfort his family and his Church with our prayers, love and affection.<br> <br>

Owing to our sinful nature we have all got the potential and the propensity to fall into error. That is why we need to thank our Lord for His Grace.<br> <br>





We all need the redemption found in Christ Jesus.<br> <br>May God the Holy Spirit baptise us with a passionate spirit of Divine Love burning within us.

	<br> <br><i> <b> 2 Corinthians Chapter 3 verse 6:</b></b> </i> 

Now God has equipped us to be capable servants of the new covenant, not by authority of the written law which only brings death, but by the Spirit who brings life.

<br><br>

Another translation.

'Who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.' </font>

<br><br>

B) I read your comment a number of times.I am sure you are aware that so many Pastors have unfortunately been sent to prison for various misdeeds.<br><br>

I love the testimony of Charles ‘Chuck’ Colson, the hatchet man to President Nixon. He was the Senior Legal Counsel to the President. He was incarcerated. The testimony here is that he founded the Prison fellowship and Break Point. Both are powerful anointed ministries and came into being after he spent time in prison.<br> <br>

I am trying to analyse your tone and tenor on how you managed to arrive at a divine prescription on how long Pastor Kong Hee should spend time in prison amounting to10 to 20 years.<br> <br>

<font style="background-color:#F6CCDA">

It will be a blessing to read of your ministry and how your lifestyle contrasts completely to that of Pastor Kong Hee. May your testimony on how you are expanding the Kingdom of God in Singapore and transforming your society encourage all of us and draw us closer to Jesus.<br> <br> </font>



 There is a Community in America that truly manifested authentic forgiveness.You must be aware that the Amish Community have gone through much persecution.<br> <br>

<a href=" https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/daily/s6/day52.htm"><font color="#0000FF"> <b> There is a righteousness that we want to truly emulate and that is the example shown by the Amish Community in America.What an amazing example to follow!</font></b></a> </b> </i> </font>

<br> <br>

 Our humble story (testimony) is below.Our prayer is: May the words found in the link comfort many people. 

<br> <br>

<a href=" https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/book/chapter1.htm"><font color="#0000FF"> <b> The challenging words of A. W. Tozer, “It is doubtful that God can use anyone greatly until He has hurt him deeply”.</font></b></a> </b> </i> </font>

<br> <br>

<font style="background-color:#F6CCDA">

C) I did read your comment. You know the old maxim that many of us have surrendered our lives to Jesus Christ, spirit, soul, body and mind but there is one significant area where we tend to keep tight control and that is in the arena of money and finances our precious lucre.

<b>I love the wise adage of a high principled man of God, the late Derek Prince, who said that we will truly know that we have completely given our lives to our Dear Lord when we surrender our purses, wallets inclusive of cash and finances to the safe bosom of our Lord.

This is when we have totally surrendered our being.</b>

<br> <br>In regard to giving our tithes, offerings and generous gifts we take them to the Throne Room and ask our Lord’s Wisdom as to whom we should share our hard earned income with. We trust and pray we will hear His voice and then hearken diligently to His Voice. We pray that every individual Christian will seek His Face and trust Him receiving perfect Shalom Peace as to which ministries to support.<br> <br>

 <b> We read scriptural verses nearly every day including Deuteronomy 28 verses 1 till 14. 

Sometimes we rapidly scan through the follow up verses, Deuteronomy 28 verse 15 till verse 68.</b></font>



<br> <br>

May our prayers, intercession and supplication comfort the congregation of City Harvest Church Singapore.<br> <br>

Also for the legal defence team involved with this case, namely Edwin Tong, N Sreenivasan, Kenneth Tan, Andre Maniam and Paul Seah.

<br>Judge See Kee Oon is set to deliver his verdict on the trial on Wednesday 21st October 2015.

<br> <br> 

<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC"><i> <b> The silver lining here is that this trial has triggered an overflow of prayer 

and intercession worldwide. This will indeed precipitate the prayer below 

leading to an outpouring of Holy Ghost power on Singapore. Thank you Jesus.</b> </i> </font> <br> <br> 



 <i>Psalm 24 verse 5 +6: They will receive blessing 

from the LORD and vindication from God their Saviour. Such is the generation of those who seek 

Him,

    who seek your face, God of Jacob.</a></font>

 Seriously engage with this above 6 minute short video clip for in 2015 the forces of hell want to vent and manifest their fury.<br> <br> The spiritual battle has already commenced.<br> <br> It is not a battle between nations, people, religion or ethnicity. It is actually a vicious battle between Kingdoms. It is Kingdom against Kingdom.<br> <br> The anointed videos will encourage you on how to be ready. It is compelling viewing. Keep the faith strong.<br> <br>At the end of the video clip there is an urgent <b>prayer request</b> to pray specifically for Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the forthcoming elections in the United Kingdom and the Presidential Elections in the United States of America. (Even a 5 minute prayer will be a sweet fragrance to the Throne Room.)</font> <br> <br>

<h2> A Prophetic Word for 2016.Anton delivered a eulogy at his Dad's farewell service, 18th April 2015, in Klang, Selangor,West Malaysia. 

<br> Meditate on these scriptures for 2016 <br> 

	Posted 10 July 2015. </h2>

<font style="background-color: #FFFFCC">

<p class="main">		

Under a strict Vatican ruling the eulogy should not have lasted longer than five minutes under the Pastoral guidance of the local Parish Priest. Thank God the former Bishop of Penang was kind to him. Anton spoke for more than thirteen minutes. He broke all conventions! Hear the eulogy on this video and find out why he spoke under such a burden. Within the talk he sensed and spoke a prophetic word for the year 2016: Please surrender your life totally to Christ Jesus.

</font>

<br> <br> 

<b> The solemn words of our Lord Jesus to you: <br>

Revelations Chapter 3 verse 20:<br> </b>

 'I am now standing at the door and am knocking. If any one listens to My voice and opens the door, I will go in to be with him and will feast with him, and he shall feast with Me.

<br> <br>

<b>

 Luke Chapter 10 verse 41-42: <br></b>

"Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. <br>

<font style="color: #A62A2A">

Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.” </font> <br> <br>

 <b> How does one live in the centre of God’s Will? </b>

A) Make a decisive dedication of your body to the Lord.<font style="color: #A62A2A">

 Romans 12 verse 1: Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.</font> <br> <br>

Make the decision to bring your body into obedience to the New Man within you.<br> <br>

<font style="color: #A62A2A">

B) Ephesians 4 verse 15: But, holding the truth in love, we may grow up to Him in all things, who is the Head, the Christ.</font> <br> <br>

Growth is the goal of the Christian. Focus and zero in. Be Heavenly minded. Take on the nature of Jesus.

<font style="color: #A62A2A">

 Psalm 73 verse 25:  Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee<br> <br> Psalm 105 verse 4 : Seek the LORD and the strength He gives! Seek His presence continually!</font>

        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from 

        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is 

        pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family 

        member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left. 

		<p class="side">

        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 

        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 

        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.

        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>

        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.

        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> The conditions are steep for Jannine </b> </a>

         she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
