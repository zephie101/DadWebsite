<h2> The forces of darkness are blasting from all quarters to spiritually attack the Trump Family. 
 </h2>

<p class="main">

</p>
<p class="main">
We need to become the armour bearers for President Trump.<br> <br> He has shown tremendous favour to all committed and dedicated Christians.<br> <br>
He has a number of times literally opened the White House for Christian representatives to come and fellowship, worship, pray and intercede within the vicinity of the President’s Residence.
<br> <br>
No other President has shown such great favour and friendliness.<br> <br>
Gratitude must be shown to Paula White -Cain. She is trained in how to combat warfare against Kingdoms of spiritual darkness.
We are so thankful to our Lord for bringing this lady of intercession so close to the President and his family.

 <u><b> On 28th August 2020. On this precious Memorial Day we received tremendous joyous news.</b></u><br> <br>

28th August 1995<br> <br>
It was on this day 25 years ago that my Dear Mum Jeyamani Theresa Nicholas was called to Heaven to be with Our Lord Jesus Christ.

 <br> <br>
Today 28th August 2020 we were presented with a gift of our first precious grandchild, a granddaughter.<br> <br>
Born at 10-50 pm to our son Paul and our daughter-in - law Gloria at StThomasHospital, London, UK.<br> <br>
Our granddaughter was determined to be born on this auspicious day. We know for we were kept up to date with the stages of the childbirth.<br> <br>
For 25 years, every year we remembered  incredible memories of our Dear Mum. The date 28th August always reminded us of our late Mum.<br> <br>
Today, 28th August 2020 our granddaughter comes into being and brings tremendous joy to us.<br><br>
There is a message therein between life and death. For Life and death are in the Hands of Our Lord.<br> <br>
The Divine Connector has got a message. In Jesus Christ we are all one for eternity. 
We are all interconnected. Heaven & Earth.
Thank you, Jesus.<br> <br> 
Our late Mum will definitely be rejoicing over the birth of her great granddaughter Abigail Nicholas. ( Abigail means My Father's Joy)

        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from 

        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is 

        pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family 

        member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left. 

		<p class="side">

        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 

        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 

        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.

        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>

        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.

        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> The conditions are steep for Jannine </b> </a>

         she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
