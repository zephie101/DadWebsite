<h2> What is the apparition of Our Lady of Medjugorje saying to the World? A Divine message from her Son,Our Lord Jesus Christ.<br> <br>
Read the encouraging testimony below:

 </h2>

<p class="main">

<h3> Located in Bosnia & Herzegovina </h3>

</p>

<p class="main">

<b> The Personal testimony of Dan Driver </b>
<br> <br>
<img class="main" src="http://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/daily/OurLadyM.jpg" width="195" height="259"  alt="Our Lady"> 

<br> <br>

"Why go to a shrine like Medjugorje that is only partially approved, with doubt, when you can go to a real shrine that is fully approved in every way?"

 <br> <br>

Well, for me, I wasn’t exactly shopping for a fully approved shrine—I was looking for a free vacation and some pretty girls. Turns out, Our Lady had other plans!

 <br> <br>

I was raised in the UK in a household marked by two contrasting spiritual landscapes: my mother’s Irish Catholic faith and my father's atheist/agnostic beliefs. This dichotomy framed my early understanding of religion, which ultimately led to a pretty common modern-day British stance of agnostic atheism.

 <br> <br>

Influenced by the less-than-inspiring examples of Catholics around me, the absence of strong male role models, and a deep-seated rational skepticism, I veered toward a life filled with hedonistic pleasures and an embrace of socialism.

 <br> <br>

My journey took a radical turn when, in my early 20s, while studying performance guitar at a leading music school, an opportunity to visit Medjugorje presented itself. Offered a free trip to attend the youth festival Mladifest in 2007 by my brother Liam, I was initially drawn by the area's rich socialist history, its Islamic influences, the prospect of a free holiday, and admittedly, the allure of the beautiful local women.

 <br> <br>

Liam assured me I could leave the religious part just after one day if it wasn’t for me.

 
<br> <br>
From day one in Medjugorje, I experienced transformational grace. Within hours of my arrival, I encountered the love Our Lady has for her children. From the depths of debauchery—just the weekend before, I had been indulging in all sorts of drugs at a rave—I was suddenly confronted with a call to follow her Son, through experiences that shook the very foundations of my disbelief.

 <br> <br>

I experienced a series of profound spiritual encounters that made me think for a moment I had gone insane. Perhaps I did, but it led me to do the sanest thing I've ever done in my life: go into the confessional.

 
<br> <br>
Over ten years of selfishness, hedonism, debauchery, and heinous sin forgiven. This would lead to me abandoning my former way of life—the good and the bad—the hedonism, debauchery, and even giving up a music scholarship and declining a business loan intended to start a charity. All this in order to begin again as a child on a journey to the faith I had so vehemently rejected.

 
<br> <br>
The rest of my week was filled with an overwhelming love for the Eucharist, Our Lady, and the Rosary, accompanied by a sudden knowledge that seemed to come from nowhere—an understanding of the truth I had long resisted. It was as though divine wisdom was quietly opening my eyes to realities I had been blind to.

 
<br> <br>
Upon returning to England, the change within me was so stark that it manifested outwardly—I cut off my dreadlocks, removed my piercings, and began repaying my debts. Even more, I encountered spiritual warfare and even demonic phenomena during the rosary, a sign that my old life’s remnants still fought for hold, though now impotent when faced with the power of the rosary. Through the support of priests who provided copious draughts of Holy Water and sacramental grace, Our Blessed Lord and Lady were working to cleanse all shadows of my past.

 <br> <br>

My spiritual reawakening led me to the Traditional Latin Mass through the FSSP in Reading, UK, which resonated with me on a profound level. Soon, my mother and brother Liam also grew devoted to the TLM, marking a familial transformation toward deeper faith. I gave up a traditional career path and devoted more than a decade to Evangelistic Catholic Ministry, and now make films about the Traditional Latin Mass.

 
<br> <br>
Medjugorje is a place where I and countless others have experienced the motherly love of Our Lady firsthand. I married an incredible woman, whose faith foundations starkly contrast mine, and together we have raised six children, all grounded in the traditional forms of the sacraments. It serves as a testament to its unique particularity as a place of grace for modern-day prodigal sons and daughters.

 <br> <br>

A common objection to Medjugorje is, "Why go to a shrine that is only partially approved, with doubt, when you can go to a real shrine that is fully approved in every way?" A reasoned answer is found in considering who often finds their way to Medjugorje. This place has shown itself not merely as a destination for the already established Catholic but rather as a beacon for the lost soul, a point of return for those adrift.

 <br> <br>

The unique grace of Medjugorje might lie in its profound capacity to offer hope to the hopeless. For someone like me, whose past was marked not by faith but by hedonism and skepticism, Medjugorje was where the unthinkable sparked—a dramatic shift toward a life grounded in the sacraments. It serves as a testament to its unique particularity as a place of grace for modern-day prodigal sons and daughters. This characteristic makes Medjugorje not just another shrine, but a critical crossroads for conversion and renewal.

 <br> <br>

My brother Liam Driver, a staunchly traditionally minded Catholic, continues to bring people to Medjugorje to witness the transformation it can bring.

 <br> <br>

For those interested, I encourage you to watch an interview with Liam and Fr. Calvin Robinson. It’s a refreshing conversation from traditionally minded Catholics who offer a take on Medjugorje that many might not expect.

 <br> <br>

As to whether the apparitions are true or not, I am not here addressing. All I can say about the veracity of Medjugorje as a place of distinct grace is to echo the profound words from the Gospel of John 9:25: "He answered, 'Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.'"<br> <br>

<b> <h2> Please urgently pray for a Holy Spirit anointed Pope.
Novena commences 7th May 2025.</h2>
 </b>

<p class="main">
The Sacred College of Cardinals during the General Congregation of Monday, April 28th last, has set the date for the beginning of the Conclave: May 7, 2025.<br> <br> Given the gravity of the situation, I ask that those who will complete the Novena on May 5th next, immediately begin a second Novena, continuing to pray the Novena Prayer until the new Successor of Saint Peter is elected. For those who have begun the novena after April 26th, I ask you to continue praying the Novena Prayer, until the new Successor of Saint Peter is elected. If you have not yet begun to pray the Novena Prayer, I urge you to begin praying it immediately. 
I thank all who have been praying the Novena Prayer or who will begin praying it now. We can be confident that Our Lady of Guadalupe will intercede powerfully for the election of a good and holy Shepherd of the Universal Church. 
Raymond Leo Cardinal BURKE 
April 29.<br> <br> 
2025 Conclave Novena Prayer.
I kneel before you, O Virgin Mother of God, Our Lady of Guadalupe, the compassionate mother of all who love you, cry to you, seek you, and trust in you. I plead for the Church at a time of great trial and danger for her. As you came to the rescue of the Church at Tepeyac in 1531, please intercede for the Sacred College of Cardinals gathered in Rome to elect the Successor of Saint Peter, Vicar of Christ, Shepherd of the Universal Church. <br> <br>


At this tumultuous time for the Church and for the world, plead with your Divine Son that the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, His Mystical Body, will humbly obey the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Through your intercession, may they choose the most worthy man to be Christ’s Vicar on earth.<br> <br> With you, I place all my trust in Him Who alone is our help and salvation. Amen. 
Heart of Jesus, salvation of those who trust in Thee, have mercy upon us! 
Our Lady of Guadalupe, Virgin Mother of God and Mother of Divine Grace, pray for us! <br> <br>

        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle
