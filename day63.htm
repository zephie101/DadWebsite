<u>Updated 5th March 2020.</u> Please urgently pray with <u>deep groanings</u> for Malaysia. We need a 'sudden' Heavenly political breakthrough.<br> <br><u>Romans Chapter 8 verse 26:</u>"In the same way the Spirit also comes to help us, weak as we are. For we do not know how we ought to pray; the Spirit Himself pleads with God for us <u>in groans</u> that words cannot express."<br> <br> On this 2020 Marriage Prophetic video below, where a father is directly speaking to his son, the essential truth on how to pray effectively with definite fruitful results will manifest themselves. Do you need a breakthrough in your Prayer Life especially in this crucial period of Lockdown? Particularly for those who are alone. Then watch the video.<br><br>This 2020 Prophetic Word is mandatory. <br> <br></u></h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXFgl9FzJPs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br< <br> <br><br><br><br>

</h2><h2>The curse (Plague) of The Coronavirus. 15th March 2020. <br> <br> <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"></span></b><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">   My wife went to the Supermarket today and the Manager told her that the main items which have been sold out are bleach and sanitizers. Within minutes many shelves were completely emptied.<br> <br> Do heed the words of Jesus Christ, Our Messiah & Saviour, Luke Chapter 21 verse 11(b) 'There will be <u>horrible plagues</u> and epidemics, cataclysmic storms on the earth, and astonishing signs and cosmic disturbances in the heavens.'Is there hope? Yes, hear the contents in the above Marriage 2020 Prophetic video.<br><br> The Daily Telegraph's recent headline: The Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Government are seriously advising the Country to visit elderly relatives before they must isolate.<br> <br> 14th March 2020, The United Kingdom Prime Minister, gave a sombre and a shocking warning that many of our elderly loved ones will not survive this vicious epidemic. </h2></u> <h3> There are some who are stating that this epidemic is the 4th Horse found in the Book of Revelation being released on the face of this earth.<br> <br><u>Revelation Chapter 6 verse 8:</u> So I looked, and behold, an ashen (pale greenish grey) horse [like a corpse, representing death and pestilence]; and its rider’s name was Death; and Hades (the realm of the dead) was following with him.<br> <br> They were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with <u> <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"></span></b><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"> plague (pestilence, disease) and by the wild beasts of the earth. <br> <br></u> A twitter quote from a friend of mine:<br> 4th March 2020. "I have seen tweets asserting that the novel coronavirus is no big deal and make comparisons with seasonal flu. <br><br>The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the novel coronavirus is deadlier than seasonal flu strains. No one has built up immunity to the new virus."<br> <br>Is there Hope? Yes, it is only found in the saving Grace of Our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ and in His very powerful Precious Blood. Please read loudly the Passion Translation of Psalm 91.<br> <br>
To those who feel totally isolated in distress and despair please consider the video below on the Lord's Prayer. Follow and voice out loudly what I am praying in this video.<br> <br> Pray word for word.
<font style="background-color: #FFFFCC" <br>		
Please make it a point to watch the video below to grasp the essence of serious Praying and Intercession, which took  place at St Mark's Church, Kennington, London, England.<br> <br><i>To protect and cover yourselves in Praise, Prayer and Intercession.<br>Saturate and soak in this scriptural verse, it's mandatory:<br></i>Psalm 139 verse 5 <br>You go before me and follow me.<br>              You place your hand of blessing on my head.</font> </b>                                <p class="main">            <object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/AYGVWXs33lE?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0"></param>            <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param>            <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>              <embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/AYGVWXs33lE?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>             </p> 
 *3rd March 2020* the Prophets & Intercessors have declared as a Global day of prayer and fasting.We desperately need  our mighty, God the Father to intervene supernaturally resist & annihilate this death infested plague released by the Kingdom of darkness.<br> <br>1. *Pray* *Psalm* *91* over your families and nations.“When we live our lives within the shadow of God Most High, our secret hiding place, we will always be shielded from harm. HOW THEN COULD EVIL PREVAIL AGAINST US OR DISEASE INFECT US?” (Passion Translation, Ps. 91:9-10)<br> <br>2. The prophets are concerned that *fear* is spreading in *epidemic* proportions in our nations. Therefore during this prayer time, we want to both pray against fear and remind ourselves that God has not given us a spirit of fear. “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind” (2 Tim. 1:7).<br> <br>3. Because fear can cause us to also make reactionary or unwise decisions, we pray for wisdom for our leaders to contain the spread of the virus while protecting their people effectively. We pray also for the crisis response teams and emergency responders in each nation to be protected and be effective.<br> <br>Two aspects of fear were identified—the fear of the contagious disease itself and the fear of lack. The fear of lack can cause economies to collapse and people to move into individual survivalism. Pray that the Lord will give individuals wisdom from Heaven during this season rather than becoming reactionary in self-protection.<br> <br>For this reason we feel this is a wake-up call that we are a global church, and that the challenges affecting other nations truly affect us all. Pray for the nations as we pray for our own!If you have been complacent about praying for other nations suffering from this virus, we encourage a time of reflection and repentance.<br> <br>4. Across the world people are being faced with the *greatest* *fear* *known* *to* *mankind* —the prospect of our own *mortality* . Pray for courage for believers to share Jesus Christ effectively through this time of crisis.<br><br>5. Many prophetic voices across the world have been prophesying the coming of the *next* *great* *awakening* , and that it will happen on a worldwide scale. Forces of evil would like to use this to either delay or disrupt the coming awakenings and revivals. Intercede that this will not happen, but rather escalate the moves of God worldwide. God wants this season to turn into a catalyst of revival instead of contagion.<br> <br>“The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV).<br> <br>6. Make a decree that this coronavirus plague will cease worldwide, and that that God will heal all who are currently affected by it.<br> <br>7. Reconsecrate yourselves, your families, and your nation to God through the taking of communion. Remember the miracle of Passover. Plead and apply the blood of the Lamb on the doorposts of your spheres.<br> <br>Thank you & thank you Jesus.</h3><br> <br></u>

<br> <br><h3></b> James Chapter 4 vv13-16. <br>Boasting About Tomorrow. <br> </b>13) Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”<br>14) Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.<br>15) Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.” <br>16) As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes.

We are lovingly calling Christians to do everything possible within their means to get involved in a Praise and Prayer meeting where the Presence of the Holy Ghost is active and real. Remember The Acts of the Apostles.
<br> <br>
This is an urgent matter for our safety, security and stability.
Please take heed!
<br> <br>
 Acts 4:13-'Now when they saw the boldness of Peter & John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marvelled. And they realised that they had been with Jesus.
 <br> <br>
Acts 4:33 and with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.

        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from 

        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is

        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 

        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 

        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.

        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>

        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).
