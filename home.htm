  <p style="font-size:1.10rem; color: var(--primary); margin-bottom:8px;">Anton Nicholas mentions the late Charlie Kirk in this video, someone Anton followed closely. His passing away precipitated a prophetic word in this video. Charlie Kirk’s memorial service will be held at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, a venue with a 63,000-person capacity.</p>
  <p style="font-size:1.10rem; color: var(--primary);">Arizona is also the location of Turning Point USA headquarters, as well as where Kirk lived with his wife, Erika, and their two children.</p>

                        <p>From co-evangelist at St. Marks Church, Kennington, to a restored life totally guided by the Holy Spirit.  If not for the gracious hand of God the Holy Spirit the narrative around Saida would be a completely different story. </p>

                    <i>The photograph is of David John Lamb with his wife Joyce Lamb née Amirdaratnam. Saida is pictured in the foreground. She worked on a voluntary basis alongside David Lamb as a co-evangelist at St. Mark's Church, Kennington.<br>
                    Saida now seriously ponders when she was involved with this aspect of evangelism why she was so subservient to all these individuals? For she had this concept that the only way she was going to be accepted and befriended by most of the local Christians was to highly esteem them. Thereby receiving in a reverential manner every counsel and advice given to her which formulated into total appeasement.<br>
                    One needs to hear Anton & Saida's wedding video much lower down, entitled, 'Jesus showed a vision of our marriage'. It had to be a real 3 dimensional vision to convince a true blue Roman Catholic to marry a lady with strong Evangelical convictions.<br>
                    It was extraordinary what the Vicar Canon Nicholas Rivett-Carnac testified about Saida. It is worth watching and hearing the testimony about how Saida sacrificed her career. Slide the video forward to 10 minutes and 17 seconds. The bridegroom nearly fell off his chair after hearing the Vicar's testimony!<br>
                    We now think the Lambs are linked with Ashford Christian Fellowship in Kent.</i><br>
                    <img src="images/main/serve.jpg" alt="Serve God, not man"><br>
                    Saida has now recognised that Our Lord should have been her main focus and her only foundation.<br>
                    <a href="book/chapter1.htm" style="color:#A62A2A; background-color:#FFFFFF"><b>Saida collapsing in anguishing pain. A very powerful story. Do follow this link for it’s revelatory in nature.</b></a><br>
                    <b>Saida, we are proclaiming these verses with zeal. May the manifestation be fulfilled with joy by proclaiming these verses:</b><br>
                    <span class="highlight">Proverbs 6:31 Someone who has stolen, shall repay sevenfold and hand over all the substance of his house and Joel Chapter 2<br>
                    25) The LORD says, “I will give you back what you lost to the swarming locusts, the hopping locusts, the stripping locusts, and the cutting locusts.”<br>
                    26) Once again you will have all the food you want, and you will praise the LORD your God, who does these miracles for you. Never again will my people be disgraced”.</span><br>
                    <a href="book/chapter1.htm">This link might surprise you</a> - For exaltation and honour has come upon our fully restored Saida. She did become a Nursing Sister, and completed a course at King's College, University of London. Also attended another course at The City University, London.<br>
                    We see the need to seriously pray for the protection of our Lord on our lives. Psalm 91 and Ephesians 6 v10–20 are read daily to combat all forms of adversaries, dangers, sicknesses, diseases etc. We reverse and boomerang back in its entire package every demonic curse/group pronouncements/utterances back to the place of origination.<br>
                    <b>Thank you Jesus.</b><br>
                    As an addendum Joyce Lamb's brother, Edward Thevaraj Amirdaratnam, was my best man at our wedding. He is married to Jane.<br>

                    The photograph is of Daniel John McGill.<br>
                    There was a period, a few years after our marriage, from February 1986 until mid June 1986 when Danny offered us accommodation at his home in Loughborough Road, Brixton.<br>
                    As a young Christian, he used to come to our first home in Prima Road, which was located near the world famous Oval Cricket Ground. He usually arrived at our home un-announced and we always offered him friendship and ministry in the Word, for he was nurturing himself in the Christian Faith. Saida always rounded up the evening by feeding him the best finely cooked Basmati rice and a delicious curry. He thoroughly enjoyed the fellowship. We have no idea where he is located now.<br>
                    On one occasion Alan Meyer stayed with Danny as part of a community. It was Alan's late dear precious wife Pippa who led the Praise and Worship for us when Anton led the prayer meetings at St. Marks, Kennington. The worship brought tremendous joy to our Lord. God The Holy Spirit manifested His Presence during the prayer meeting.<br> <br>
                    <a href="daily/s1/day8.htm">Read a further story</a> regarding what happened during Pippa Meyer's last few hours before she went to be with our Lord.<br><br>
                    It was during this time we also became acquainted with Gerry Kearney from the Republic of Ireland. We used to worship and shared bread, (Holy Communion) together at a charismatic church in North London, Victory Christian Centre, Hampstead.<br><br>
                    We also want to acknowledge the assistance of Steven Burton in helping us transport our belongings from Loughborough Road, Brixton to Peckham. Mary, whom we also knew, married Steve Burton. Steve and Danny ran a joint business partnership together during this period, 1986. (Steve in carpentry and Danny in bricklaying etc.)<br><br>
                    It was also during this period of time that we took care of Jonathan Gwilt when he stayed in our basement, from August 1990 till February 1991. He was completing his Chartered Accountancy Exams. He left our premises just before our daughter Jannine was born. A qualified Chartered Accountant whom we believe might be employed as the Financial Director of Elim Kensington Temple.<br><br>
                    It is so extraordinary that years later our Daughter in Law Gloria Nicholas, whilst staying with us, also completed her Chartered Accountancy Exams. She is now joyfully employed with Holy Trinity Clapham,UK as their Finance Manager.</p>

                    <h2>Lead Kindly Light</h2>
                    <p>John Henry Newman, who was a young English Priest, wrote the Hymn Lead Kindly Light when he was afflicted with a serious illness. This occurred whilst staying in the island of Sicily which is situated near Italy. He was far from home and really believed he was facing death. In one extraordinary moment, which I refer to it as a touch from the Lord, The Blessed Cardinal Newman wrote this very moving hymn. It will definitely minister to all those who are facing loneliness, darkness and confusion.<br>

Between 8 pm and 8-30 pm, darkness had fallen and most of the 80,000 congregants assembled were on their knees, heads bowed in solemn prayer on the grass in Hyde Park. In devotion and reverence this Hymn was sung, “Lead Kindly Light”.</b><br>

                    <p><img src="images/main/reception.jpg" alt="Anton & Saida's wedding reception"><br>
                    It was in 1980 in St. Mark’s Church, Kennington, London Saida co worked as an Evangelist when the late Canon Sir Nicholas Rivett-Carnac, was the Vicar of St. Mark’s Church, (Vicar from 1972-1989). She was the first individual from the congregation, of over 600, who accepted the calling to do “tent making”. A pioneer within St. Marks, she sacrificed her financial pursuits in order to have the free time available to tell the local people about Jesus.<br>
                    I need to state in here the words of <span style="color: var(--highlight);">1 Cor.15 verse 58: Be steadfast - in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain</span> - although I must add quickly that her recognised gifting was publicly spoken of and declared from the pulpit on the day of our marriage where more than 400 people were invited to attend our wedding and feast at our reception.<br>
                    <img src="images/main/wedding2.jpg" alt="Anton & Saida's wedding reception"><br>
                    The photograph below was taken before Saida left, Kampala, Uganda. Having completed part of her education at The Aga Khan School located on Makerere Road, Old Kampala.<br>
                    <img src="images/main/saida_young.jpg" alt="Saida as a child"><br>
                    This was a place of familiarity compared to the United Kingdom especially as she travelled unaccompanied on the flight to Gatwick Airport. As you can see, at this stage she was oozing with tremendous self confidence and assurance. These positive aspects were severely shaken during her time at a much sought after top Grammar School in North London. For she had to confront an issue that came out unexpectedly that caused many reverberations.<br>
                    If you are curious <a href="book/chapter1.htm">do check out how the issue manifested itself.</a> Thereafter through unwise counselling her confidence was severely shaken in London.<br>
                    Saida was once a model but we hear someone saying that this modelling phenomenon is a lark - <a href="profiles/saida_modelling.htm">well check it out!</a><br>
                    <a href="thefruitofprayer.htm">Do watch a snippet</a> of a very popular TV programme of Saida at work viewed by a significant global audience shown at peak time on BBC 1. A picture of Saida (radiantly joyful) and the family are at the very bottom of this home page.<br>
                    The problem was that Saida had a surplus, an overflow of spiritual mothers, spiritual fathers, counselors, advisors, mentors and during our courtship loads of engagement and marriage counselors etc, etc, etc.<br>
                    <span class="highlight">She lost her own father when he died at a very young age of 42 years and Saida was only sixteen months old.</span><br>
                    The lessons behind this are, if one does not spend hours praying, an individual would not be able to recognize the authentic voice of God. The flip side to this, devoid of prayer, one begins to move into the realm of confusion, distortion, the enemy moves in, in various disguises and without discerning it, one will be pulled into the realm of counseling fodder.<br>
                    If only the counsellors had fulfilled this verse, it would have saved Saida a lot of heartache, much grief, torment of soul and intense pain: <span style="color: var(--highlight);">Acts 6 v 4: '...and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word. v5: This proposal pleased the whole group.'</span><br>
                    <b>Fellowshipping with Jesus in the Word and in Prayer.</b><br>
                    <span class="highlight">For its through continuously acknowledging the Presence Of The HOLY GHOST, constant and consistent prayer, saturating, soaking the Word of God that will manifest sound and wise counseling.</span><br>
                    Anton also led a well-attended early morning prayer meeting for about two years in the upstairs chambers at St. Marks Church Kennington, London, with an emphasis on united prayer visit:<br>
                    <i>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity… for there the Lord commanded the blessing – life evermore!</i> The format was the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

We chose to have an English afternoon tea when someone told us that the British Monarch, Queen Elizabeth II and the Prince Consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh stayed in this grand hotel. The first to live in this seven-bedroom/nine-bathroom mansion was British Resident-General Sir Frank Swettenham in 1896. We also celebrated part of Paul's birthday there.</i><br>
                    During July/August 2008 we were in Malaysia celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The most precious week occurred during our time on the mountain top in Cameron Highlands, Pahang, around 5000 feet above sea level. When we came back "to earth" arriving in Kuala Lumpur from this resort we attended a church in Petaling Jaya and to hear what happened please click the link below: Before becoming a Pastor, Rev Roy Muttiah actually worked as a Barrister.

                    <i>Pastor Roy is the brother in law to the late Dr. Joy Seevaratnam of Penang, Malaysia. (Dr. Joy passed away into the Lord's Presence on 7th January 2014). In 1985 Dr. Joy and his wife Elsie prophesied to us as a family and every word of the prophecy has come to pass. Although he was a medical Doctor he operated more in signs and wonders and he offered his patients the option to be prayed for. Given the fact that in Malaysia a patient pays for his prescription from his own income, for the economically deprived this can be quite expensive.

                    <h2>Church Life</h2>
                    <p>The Nicholas family worshipped at All Saints Church, Peckham for 13 years. From 20th July 2003 till the 23rd May 2010 the presiding Vicar was Rev. Frog Orr-Ewing. His wife is Amy Orr-Ewing.<br>
                    For some time Anton led an early morning prayer meeting at St. Marks Chambers. During this period the Vicar was Nicholas Rivett-Carnac. Not many people in St. Marks were aware of his family history. His father ended his naval career as a Vice-Admiral and was involved in both World Wars, 1 and 2. He commanded the battleship Rodney and was Rear-Admiral in charge of the Normandy Beaches during the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944.<br>
                    At the Memorial and Thanksgiving service for Nicholas Rivett-Carnac held at St. Marks Church on 23rd of October 2004 we heard Bishop Peter Walker, a former Principal of Westcott House Theological College Cambridge, saying in his testimonial that the wife of the Rear Admiral told the Bishop that if her husband had just made one mistake, it would have changed the whole direction of the war. What an awesome responsibility!<br>
                    Nicholas Rivett-Carnac joined the Scots Guards. He spent 10 years with the regiment, <span style="color: var(--highlight);">serving as a platoon commander during the fierce fighting in Malaya,</span> when he was mentioned in dispatches. He returned home in time to take part in the Coronation Procession in 1953. This clan of the Rivett-Carnacs were either Military men or Vicars. It's just an interesting note that Nicholas Rivett Carnac served in both capacities.<br>

            <p><b><a href="profiles/dietitian.htm">Profile of Valerie Meilton</a></b><br>
            On Friday, 16th January 1999, we were in Valerie’s house in Claygate, Surrey. At 11-15 pm we were about to leave for London, we went to say goodnight to Valerie’s Mum Vera Meilton. It was during this momentous moment she looked directly at us and told us in a rather sweet indirect fashion, “Please take care of my only daughter”. She was clearly unwell, the final words she uttered to us were, “All you need is Jesus.” We then prayed and anointed Vera with Holy oil and dedicated her to the sweet Presence of Jesus. 6 days later she died peacefully at Kingston General Hospital, with Valerie holding her hands.<br>
            The final words of Valerie‘s Mum to us echo so closely to the wonderful quotation of Oswald Chambers: “They feared as they entered the cloud.” Is there anyone, “save Jesus only” in your cloud? If so, it will get darker; you must get into the place where there is “no one save Jesus only”.<br>
            Valerie’s father passed away on 6th May 1991. Valerie has now become a member of our family.<br>

            <p>Our honeymoon was a very generous wedding gift from these kind people, the Rev. Michael Barling and the late Helen Clarke. When we knew Michael he was then the acting Vicar at St Marks Church, Kennington whilst Nicholas was on his sabbatical leave. Michael was also the former Principal of School of Ministry at Kingdom Faith, Horsham, linked to Kingdom Faith Ministries which was led by the late Senior Pastor Colin Urquhart.<br>
            Both Michael and Helen booked us into a very beautiful large en suite bedroom at the Harte & Garter Hotel on the High Street at Windsor exactly facing Windsor Castle where occasionally the Royal Family resides. This hotel has individually designed bedrooms. It offers an unrivalled view over Windsor Castle. All our expenses were paid for by them. This thoughtful generous gift will always be treasured! We actually ate quite a lot of steak during this time.<br>
            For a period of time the Reverend Michael and June Barling ministered in a church near Taunton. The Church is referred to as Kingdom Faith South West, Taunton, Somerset.<br>
            Helen Smith Clark was promoted to Heaven on the 21st of September 2005. She was in her eighties. We did attend her funeral held on the 12th of October 2005 at a beautifully located village church, St. Mary’s Church, Balcombe, West Sussex.<br>

            Our fresh breaking news in 2009 is that Paul will be receiving his MA from Cambridge, March 2009, and his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc. His graduation ceremony, for his MSc, will take place in the Royal Albert Hall in May 2009. On 17th July 2009 Paul conveyed the thrilling news to us that he had passed his final Actuarial Paper. Today 24th July 2009 his name was published in the London Times, page 68 stating he is now a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. Well done Paul! You can relax now and enjoy your profession as a fully qualified Actuary.<br>
            The further breaking news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="profiles/benedict.htm">Benedict Ponniah</a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.<br>
