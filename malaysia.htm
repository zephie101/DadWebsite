                    <p>Introducing my youngest brother, Fintan Nicholas and family, who are currently residing in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Fintan works as the Associate Director of International Dealing Division at Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad. Fintan heads the Inter-Broke Dealing team there and he is also the Senior Dealer.</p>
                    <p>His wife Jiun Nicholas, née Yong Kwa Jiun, is the Commercial Senior Director at a well-known international organisation near Kuala Lumpur. We want to thank the Living God for blessing, promoting and honouring them to their high positions. They are carrying their son Luke. Please continue to intercede for their whole family, and join us in prayer for their young son Gerard. Father God, we will Praise You Heavenly Father and maintain a joyful spirit for manifesting your Presence through the continuous miracle you are mightily and wondrously working on the life of Gerard Veerasingam Nicholas.</p>
                    <p>On 14th April 2015 in the UK, Saida visually saw a prophetic vision of an intensely bright light encircling Anton's Dad, Albert, drawing him into Heaven. Anton’s Dad in Malaysia aged 99 years old had moved to our Lord’s Presence the day before - 13th April 2015. On 26th July 2015 Anton for the first time called a public meeting in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia to honour his Dad's legacy. Without much advertising a group of people turned up at the Ball Room, Ascott Central Kuala Lumpur. Watch the video to observe how much his late Dad would have loved his son speaking so passionately.</p>

                    <p>During our last visit to Malaysia we had tremendous fellowship together and at every given opportunity we prayed fervently and confessed the Word of God loudly. Occasionally we played the powerful worship rendition of Terry Macalmon as background music to enhance the atmosphere of prayer. We also are rejoicing that Jiun often prays whilst this anointed CD is playing as she drives to work.</p>
                    <p class="highlight">1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.</p>

                    <p>Vanessa is the first grandchild in our Nicholas family to be married. Commencing from left to right are Emmanuel Savundranayagam, our son Paul Nicholas, my youngest brother Fintan Nicholas, my eldest brother Joseph J.

We have prayed faithfully daily that the blessing in the original garden of Eden would manifest fully on them both and our Lord has been ever faithful. The surroundings reflect a miniscule image, a primitive shadow of what the garden of Eden would look like: can you imagine how glorious it would have been with the majestic Presence of God abiding in the garden!</p>

                    <p>Please click here to read a letter from our late dear Reverend Father Christopher Cutler, parish priest of St. Joseph's Church, Leyton, London UK. (The Order of the Claretian Missionaries) highly recommending Juliana to be granted the opportunity to sing her anointed psalms.) <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/audio/lordlight.mp3"><b>Listen to one of the tracks from 'The Lord is my Light' please click here:</b></a></p>
                    <p>A 'revival bud' has taken place through the anointed CD, 'The Lord is my Light', the songs being sung by Juliana and directed by her husband Sylvester Nicholas. Alfred Aaron Lee composed the songs. A tremendous, miraculous sales breakthrough has taken place in Malaysia and Singapore. The Catholic churches in Malaysia have opened their doors for this CD to be sold to their parishioners. It looks like the prayers of our late mother Theresa Nicholas have been answered, for she was the one who got up every morning at about 3-30am to intercede and supplicate for her children to follow the ways of the Lord. She must be rejoicing in Heaven with all the other saints with how the CD is blessing the Spirit, Soul, Body and Mind of the Christians and the non Christians. God the Holy Ghost is breaking through all denominational barriers now. This CD is now penetrating the Anglican Church, the Methodist, the House Churches, the Lutheran and Praise be to God the Pentecostal and the Charismatic churches. We rejoice that the Covenant Keeping, 'Lord of the Breakthrough' is breaking barriers and the CD has gone beyond Malaysia and will soon be selling in Australia.</p>

                    <p>Further update: 18/01/03 Sylvester and Juliana have penetrated a significant proportion of the Christian churches in the Royal Kingdom of Brunei. We see this as an act of the Holy Ghost. To all the people involved in this venture we want to say thank you.</p>
                    <p>Thanksgiving items for all these churches that invited Juliana to perform live:</p>
                    <p>1. Juliana has already performed live in over 100 churches in Malaysia, this includes the States of Sarawak, Sabah and the country of Singapore. We rejoice that the Catholic Archbishop of Singapore Msgr. Nicholas Chia has given his blessings and approval for Sylvester and Juliana to approach the local Catholic churches. This is a significant move. Thank God!</p>
                    <p>Thanks be to God, this CD is now making a great breakthrough in Sabah, East Malaysia. A sincere thank you to Monsignor Primus of the Sacred Heart Cathedral, for the tremendous affection and help rendered to Sylvester and Juliana during their stay in Sabah.</p>
                    <p>Also a word of gratitude and thanksgiving to the Covenant Groups of Sabah & the Prayer Group of the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Kota Kinabalu and most importantly to Bro. Eddie the director of Mont fort Youth Training Centre and Helena for all the love shown to Sylvester & Juliana. All of you manifested the genuine love of Jesus Christ and gave them a very warm welcome.</p>

                    <p>Glory be to God – Sylvester and Juliana were invited to perform in a concert in the United Kingdom! They did the first rendition of the psalms at the Harlequin Theatre in Redhill, Surrey on Thursday 29th May 2003.</p>
                    <p>On 19th May 2003 Sylvester and Juliana went to Premier Christian Radio (London, UK) to do an interview about their visit and the concerts and the CD, on the Rick Easter show at lunchtime. Rick ran a competition to win a copy of the CD The Lord is My Light and a pair of tickets to the CMC concert. Praise God!</p>
                    <p>The BBC interviewed them too & UCB (United Christian Broadcasters) reviewed the CD for inclusion in their terrestrial and satellite radio stations' playlists across Europe. Thank God! <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/itinerary.htm"><b>View their itinerary here</b></a></p>
                    <p>Our Heavenly Father favoured Sylvester and Juliana by allowing Juliana to sing at England's favourite spiritual place, Walsingham. Juliana sang at an open air service in front of 3000 people. On one occasion the vast gathering even applauded her, which deeply touched the bishops and the other clergy, because it happened during a Holy mass service. (The clapping of hands is an unusual occurrence during Mass). August 2003. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/realmedia/sunday/s20030810z.ram"><b>BBC Radio 4's religious program, broadcast on Sunday 10th August happened to interview them during a report on Walsingham.</b></a></p>

                    <p>Anton was an orthodox, ultra-conservative, true blue Roman Catholic, a faithful early morning daily communicant. Since the age of 5 family prayer was a daily occurrence. Jesus had to appear personally in a three dimensional open vision for Anton to receive a Heavenly assurance to marry an evangelical Christian. Do view the video below to witness how the narrative in the vision came to fulfilment. Ever since then their lives took on an unexpected course. Hear and view the prophetic word proclaimed to Anton & Saida by the Rev. Father Michael Gwinnell and the late Rev. Canon Nicholas Rivett-Carnac, the former Vicar of St. Marks Church, Kennington.</p>

                    <p><i>View the video above to see why a reference is made to Rev: Jean Darnall. This was the lady who taught Anton a lot about the Holy Ghost. She is currently a Pastoral Elder with Pastor Jack Hayford. Pastor Jack was the founding Pastor of The Church On The Way in Van Nuys, California. Jean was one time an Associate Pastor at the world famous Angelus Temple originally founded by Aimee Semple McPherson. We did note that during July 2010 another lady, Rev Tammy Dunahoo was appointed General Supervisor of this Pentecostal Denomination.</i></p>

            <p>Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.</p>
            <p>The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.</p>
