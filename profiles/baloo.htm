We are deeply grateful to the grandson Mr Sultan R Baloo and his wife Roshan. We met this couple after a long period of absence. We visited them in Vancouver, Canada, this spring 2016.
Mr Sultan Baloo very kindly provided us with this above valuable information.
<br> <br>
The photograph below shows some members of Saida&#39;s family.

        This photo was taken in 1991.<br>  Seated from left to right: Sadhru Tarmohamud, his wife Roshan, (Saida's sister),  Naseem & Badhur Baloo, ( her sister & brother).
         Standing left to right are Shellina née Tarmohamud,  Nizar Baloo, Nazma &  Mahmud Tarmohamud. Nizar Karmali Baloo( brother) and family reside in Surrey, United Kingdom.
        The rest of Saida's family seen in this picture are currently residing in British Columbia, Canada.<br> <br>
		Sadly Saida's sister Roshanbanu Sadru Tarmohamed passed away on Friday 30th June 2023 in Vancouver, Canada.<br>Saida has fond memories of her beloved sister.
		
		<br> <br>
		Now and then we do pass a" Jamat Khana" on Addiscombe Road, Croydon, Surrey, just opposite the Sandilands tram stop. <br> <br> 20th April 2023: Just received the sad news that Saida's sister in law Yasmin Baloo passed away. We grieve the precious loss of Nizar Baloo's wife. We convey our deep condolences to the family. For the first time we will attend the Jamat Khana for the funeral.<br>
		<br> A sad note that Bahadur Baloo passed away peacefully on 16th April 2020 at 6pm. The funeral service will take place on Friday 24th April 2020 at Burnaby and he will he be buried in Surrey, Canada.<br> <br> We are so thankful that we had a grand time with him in the year 2016. Due to the global Covid-19 epidemic we were sadly unable to attend the funeral but he will be fondly remembered. <br> <br>

		<br> <br>
We are grateful to our research assistant Valerie Meilton for spending many hours at the Reference section in the massive and renowned British Library, positioned at 96 Euston Rd, London, NW1 2DB, UK. She decided to research references to B. P. Nicholas and his immediate family. Just to extract one single item of information is a mammoth task. She definitely needs a pay increase!! If you are curious to know who Valerie Meilton is:

		Our son Paul  graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005.
<br> <br>
In 2003 he became a Scholar when he secured a first in his part 1 A of his tripos.

Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.
<br> <br>
Our daughter Jannine is now studying law at St. John's College, Cambridge. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her 
<a href="http://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#FF8C00"><b>
 grand Uncle Benedict Ponniah, </b></a>
 (Did Malaya miss out on an elite Malaysian becoming Secretary General of the United Nations?) A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew. (The first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).
<br> <br>
A marginal difference was that Mr Lee graduated with the rare Double Starred First Class Honours in the year 1949. Very few have achieved this!!
<br> <br>
The conditions were steep for Jannine, she had to
<a href="http://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#FF8C00"><b>
 obtain a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects. </b></a>
<br> <br>
Results published, 20th August 2009
From the above it is evidently very clear that St John's College, insisted on Jannine receiving a minimum of 3 A stars for her A level subjects. <b> Just being awarded an A grade was not sufficient for Cambridge. </b> Jannine received 96% for Economics, 91% for Chemistry, Mathematics 89% and Latin 87%. At 7-30 pm we received this news: Congratulations! Your place at University of Cambridge to study Law has been confirmed.

<br> <br>
In March 2009 Paul received his MA from Cambridge. He also graduated with a Msc, from Imperial College London, for which he was awarded a distinction (a first). His graduation ceremony for his MSc, took place at the Royal Albert Hall, May 2009. On 17th July 2009 Paul conveyed the thrilling news to us that he had passed his final Actuarial Paper. . On 24th July 2009 his name was published in the London Times, page 68, stating he is now a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. Well done Paul! You can relax now and enjoy your profession as a fully qualified Actuary.
