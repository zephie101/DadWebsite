                    <h3>A Brief Profile: Dietitian Experienced in Both NHS and Private Sectors</h3>
                    <p>Valerie graduated from Reading University with an honours degree in Zoology and then completed her dietetics training at the University of London. She rose to become Chief III Dietitian at Guy's Teaching Hospital in London. Whilst at Guy's, she played a vital part in setting up a Clinical Nutrition Working Party which produced an Enteral Feeding Policy. She also trained about 12 Dietetic Students a year, many of whom now hold senior positions in various hospitals throughout the United Kingdom. She assisted in various research projects, one of which included the effect of a long-term fat-modified diet on serum lipoprotein levels of cholesterol and triglyceride in patients on home haemodialysis (published in Clinical Science 1981).</p>
                    <img src="../images/profiles/DIET.gif" width="320" height="470" alt="Valerie Meilton" loading="lazy">
                    <p>In 1991, Valerie pioneered the dietetic service at a Rehabilitation Hospital and a Hospice in West London. She also had experience as a Community Dietitian within a Home Support Team (which included HIV-positive clients). Valerie acted single-handedly as the Dietitian at the prestigious Princess Grace Hospital and the Harley Street Clinic. Whilst there, she took sole responsibility for both hospitals, which included 2 ITU units and a renal unit. The patients came from all over the world. She also wrote diet sheets for private consultant referrals and gained experience on the management side too.</p>

                    <h3>Smoking Cessation at Hillview Surgery</h3>
                    <p>Valerie Meilton is a Smoking Cessation Community Advisor. She underwent training with The Thelma Golding Centre of Ealing, Hammersmith, and Hounslow Smoking Cessation Service. We offer a word of thanks to Dr. Shergill of Hillview Surgery, Bilton Road, Perivale, Greenford, Middlesex, who encouraged Valerie to take up this venture.</p>
                    <p>At the initial visit, we explain the treatment process and give clients advice about possible medication. After discussing their smoking habits, we then take a carbon monoxide reading, which is repeated at every visit to assess progress. We help clients prepare for their individual quit day and see them once a week to offer encouragement. This encouragement is really necessary for someone who wants to give up smoking. It is very much a team effort: clients are referred by GPs or Practice Nurses, often from a new patient check; reception staff book the client for the six-week course and help in the smooth running of the clinics.</p>

A pastor once elaborated on this word unity: We are united on the Major Points which leads to a common harmony. The major points are inserted within the website.</p>
                    <p><b>Psalm 133 verse 3</b><br>Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon that falls on the mountains of Zion. And the LORD has pronounced his blessing, even life forevermore.</p>

                    <img src="../images/profiles/grad_val.jpg" width="390" height="550" alt="Paul's Graduation" loading="lazy">
                    <p>Our son Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. In 2003, he became a Scholar when he secured a first in his Part 1A of his tripos. <a href="../scholar.htm">It's an impressive photo!</a> Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine, and our adopted family member Valerie, who is positioned on the extreme left.</p>
                    <p>In March 2009, Paul received his MA from Cambridge. He also graduated with an MSc from Imperial College London, for which he was awarded a distinction (a first). His graduation ceremony for his MSc took place at the Royal Albert Hall, May 2009. On 17th July 2009, Paul conveyed the thrilling news to us that he had passed his final Actuarial Paper. On 24th July 2009, his name was published in the London Times, page 68, stating he is now a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. Well done Paul! You can relax now and enjoy your profession as a fully qualified Actuary.</p>
                    <p>Our daughter Jannine is now studying law at St. John's College, Cambridge. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her <a href="benedict.htm">grand Uncle Benedict Ponniah</a> (Did Malaya miss out on an elite Malaysian becoming Secretary General of the United Nations?), a Queen's Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr &amp; Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (The first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). A marginal difference was that Mr. Lee graduated with the rare Double Starred First Class Honours in the year 1949. Very few have achieved this!!</p>
                    <p>The conditions were steep for Jannine; she had to <a href="jannine.htm">obtain a minimum mark of 90% for her A-level subjects</a>. Results published, 20th August 2009: From the above, it is evidently very clear that St John's College insisted on Jannine receiving a minimum of 3 A stars for her A-level subjects. <b>Just being awarded an A grade was not sufficient for Cambridge.</b> Jannine received 96% for Economics, 91% for Chemistry, Mathematics 89%, and Latin 87%. At 7:30 pm, we received this news: Congratulations! Your place at University of Cambridge to study Law has been confirmed. <a href="jannine.htm">Read why praying was mandatory</a>.</p>
