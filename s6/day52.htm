<p>On 27<sup>th</sup> April 2010 at 6-48 am I heard Pastor Chuck Swindoll on 
Premier Christian Radio citing this moving story. He stated that a pastor was 
preaching at a church service for the people who had died in the mid air 
collision over the Grand Canyon, near the Pacific, some years ago.</p>
<p>Obviously this made all the newspaper headlines. A number of people were 
killed in this tragic accident. A young minister who was living locally was 
invited to take the memorial service. He knew virtually no-one who had been 
killed but he decided to make himself available as a witness on behalf of the 
Lord. As he stood he began to assure the sorrowful crowd that God was present, 
that God was near and God cares. There was a man who was unable to cope with his 
grief and with a large frown stood to his feet and shouted <b>‘Then where was 
God when this happened?'.</b> This young maturing minister had never faced such 
an event or incident ever before. He knew that he had to be sensitive to that 
precious situation. He had to muster great wisdom to handle this delicate 
moment. </p>
<p>He paused, thought deeply and asked whether everyone had heard the question 
that had been posed: 'Where was God when this happened?' He said, 'The only 
answer I have is that God was in the same place He was when men took His Son, 
Jesus, and crucified Him on the cross'.</p>
</font></span><span LANG="EN"><font SIZE="5">
<p>I need to mention here what Philip Yancey preached two weeks after 33 people 
(28 students and 5 faculty members) sadly died on the Virginia Tech campus in 
Blacksburg, Virginia, United States on 16<sup>th</sup> April 2007.</font></span><span LANG="EN-GB">
</p>
</span><font SIZE="5"><span LANG="EN">
<p>‘</span><span LANG="EN-GB">What we do know, with full confidence, is how God 
feels. We know how God looks on the campus of Virginia Tech right now because 
God gave us a face, a face that was streaked with tears. Where misery is, there 
is the Messiah.’</p>
<p>Philip Yancey goes on to state a story that a man asked him once about a book 
he wrote called, <b>‘<i>Where Is God When It Hurts</i>?’ </b>&quot;Well, I don't have 
much time to read. Can you just answer that question for me in a sentence or 
two?&quot; He thought for a second and said, &quot;I guess I'd have to answer that with 
another question: 'Where is the church when it hurts?' </p>
<p>What a church did, read below.</p>
<p>Philip then mentions the powerful true story that even the broad sheet papers 
in the United Kingdom reported. Referencing the Amish county near the site of 
the Nickel Mines school shootings, October 2nd 2006. The media came to report on the horrible 
incident that took place. For it was a heinous crime of an extreme proportion. 
For the State Police Commissioner reported that the brutal murderer had intended 
to victimise the child hostages prior to executing them. They had to change their headlines when they were 
overwhelmed and captured by the amazing love shown by the Amish people. The 
Amish were not asking,&nbsp; <b>'Where is God when it hurts?' </b>They knew 
where God was. With their long history of persecution, the Amish were not 
buffeted by an outbreak of evil. They rallied together, <b>embraced the killer's 
family, ministered to each other, and healed wounds by relying on a sense of 
community strengthened over centuries.</b> The hardened reporters were softened by 
the emotional and Christian strength of character of the Amish people. Glory be 
to God.</p>

Outside Greater London, the Lake District was the first place I visited in 1973. 
The scenic mountain views gave me great pleasure. My brother married a lady

<p>It was such a comfort to view and read the total involvement of the Churches 
in Cumbria regarding the tragedy. Many of the Pastors who were involved in the 
memorial services and prayer vigils made headline news in the mass media. We 
heard that at Carlisle Cathedral, St Michael’s Chapel, had been set aside for 
prayer and contemplation . Canon Michael Manley led prayers and lit 13 candles, 
Another Vicar, The Rev Richard Lee, spoke of the tranquillity of the village: 
&quot;Suddenly, it all stopped.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev Jonathan Falkner, minister at 
the local Gosforth church offered prayers for the deceased. </p>
<p>The Revd Rachel Poolman, president of the United Reformed Church and 
president of Churches Together in Cumbria, urged Christians everywhere to pray 
for all those affected in any way by the shootings.The Anglican, Catholic, 
Methodist, United Reformed, and Baptist church leaders offered prayers for the 
“close-knit and hugely supportive” communities of West Cumbria. <br>

The photograph below was taken in the year 1973.I believe it's a barge that I am 
standing next to. The sad feature here is that I visited the Lake District near 
Whitehaven during the peak of winter. Hence I am wearing my first winter coat 
purchased at the Portebola Market, London. Suffice to say I still enjoyed my 
memorable stay in Cumbria. I believe this barge was on Lake Windermere.</p>
