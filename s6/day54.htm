       <h2>9th November 2012 The Right Reverend Justin Welby, pictured below, 
        the former Bishop of Durham, has just been confirmed, as the 105th 
        Archbishop of Canterbury.</h2>

           <font color="#C00" size=5em>
          What a start to the beginning of his ministry at the highest realm.Praying,Interceding and mentioning the name of Jesus constantly.</font>

<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC"><br> <br>Archbishop Justin Welby will be travelling around the Province of Canterbury to pray. We heard him say that God The Holy Spirit must be the initiator for all these prayer innovations. From March 14th – March 19th he will visit five cities and six cathedrals; everyone is invited to come along and join him on the 
          <b>Journey in Prayer</b> <br><br> 
            The Archbishop will visit one city on each day of the journey, and spend that day in prayer. Those who join the Archbishop in prayer will be able to pray in ways that reflect the broad traditions of Anglican spirituality. He said: “The key role of the Archbishop is to be a facilitator and catalyst… there is the capacity to bring people together and encourage and build up”.
          <b>His message is “The key thing is to be centred on</b> <b>Jesus Christ</b> – that’s why we start with prayer. The church praying together and gathering to pray is something that draws other people to faith in Christ.” 
To all this we say Amen and Alleluia.
<br> <br>
A spokesperson for Canterbury Cathedral said the enthronement ceremony of Archbishop Justin Welby will be an “all-singing, all-dancing service”. It will be broadcast live at 2-30 pm on Thursday March 21st 2013, BBC2.
Please do prayerfully watch the service. You will be blessed for doing so!
<br> <br>
We will also strongly recommend for all of us to watch live, The Inauguration Mass of Pope Francis1 be on Tuesday March 19th 2013 at 9-30 am at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican. This is also the Feast Day of St Joseph. A special Saint in Catholic circles. This will be a once in a lifetime Mass service.
<br> <br> </font>

          
          <img class="main" src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/daily/popefrancis.jpg" width="246" height="205" alt="Pope Francis I"> 
           <br> <br>
We first saw Bishop Justin Welby on BBC a couple of years ago speaking to none 
          other than the formidable, (a bulldog type of interviewer) Jeremy 
          Paxman on Newsnight. One is aware of Jeremy’s views towards religion. Just for a brief minute let me take a prayerful diversion here and make a comment about the interview I saw between Jeremy Paxton on BBC 2’s flagship Newsnight programme and Richard Dawkins on 13th September 2011.<br> <br> Mr Dawkins was advertising his first children’s book. It is pertinent that I 
          <b>quote</b> the very appropriate words of the journalist Stephen Glover of the Daily Mail. This article was published on 15th September 2011. “The usual sceptical and tenacious Mr Paxman was a gentle version full of smiles and laughs. The truth is that it is unimaginable that a Christian thinker would be allowed to promote his book and thoughts unopposed on Newsnight or any other BBC programme as Richard Dawkins was” 
          <b>end of quote. <br></b><br>Stephen Glover goes on to expound what type of Archbishop he prefers—His ideal would be someone who stands up to the mounting tide of militant atheism and secularism which constitute the real danger to Christianity. He goes on to say that we need someone to champion the sanctity of human life and mobilise the church against aggressive euthanasia. May our Lord bless you Mr. Stephen Glover. I have archived your article for others to read.
<br><br>
We were actually very impressed on how the Bishop of Durham conducted himself during this interview. The Reverend came out as a very knowledgeable economist and he knew his brief very well. So all this is excellent material to affirm the Archbishop candidacy. Also contributing to his appointment is his business acumen as a Group Treasurer for an oil company and more recently being on a Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. I was fortunate to observe the Archbishop grilling the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, when the Parliamentary Committee were inquiring into the culture and practices of the financial services industry.
<br> <br>
<font style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
Associated with this is also his prayerful/spiritual quality. He has a passionate affinity towards Roman Catholic spirituality, example being reading the writings of St. Ignatius of Loyola. One of Ignatius&nbsp; quotes .“Act as if everything depended on you; trust as if everything depended on God.” This spirituality is vital for all these readings, meditation and contemplations of the Roman Catholic Saints has reinforced his prayer life. I myself have perceived this strongly when visiting the Roman Catholic cathedrals and sitting and meditating in the quiet chapel. What a spiritual impetus I received when I went on a retreat to the Cistercian Monastery in Tipperary It is mandatory that we need an Archbishop that prays fervently, effectively and prophetically. We need a spiritual man ,discerning the 'dark times' we are living in now.</font>
<br> <br>
Friends who knew him well at Cambridge University tell us how painfully he and his wife survived the ordeal and the intense grieving they went through at the tragic loss of their seven month old daughter, Johanna, in a car accident. Oh, tragedies, afflictions formulate the character of any man and woman! Have mercy on us Lord!
<br> <br>
To all those beloved who have lost precious members of their family through unexpected tragedies might find

<br> <br>
Bishop Welby is married to Caroline Eaton and they have five children. They are&nbsp; Tim, 28, Peter, 23, Katherine, 26, Eleanor, 20 and Hannah, 17. Looks like a solid English family that has been strengthened through trials and tribulations. He comes (prayer answered) from the evangelical wing of the diverse Church of England and has had formidable grounding with the Alpha Course and the Focus gatherings.

We also thank our Lord for his close association with Holy Trinity Brompton. We wish most churches in the United Kingdom had the spiritual zeal of Holy Trinity Brompton, especially like the Vicar Nicky Gumbel who always invocate God the Holy Spirit somewhere in his sermons.
<br><br>
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC">
We wish the newly appointed Archbishop every blessing. We pray for God’s wisdom and that he will be an example of a true witness of the Spirit of Our Lord Jesus Christ. May he proclaim a great spiritual awakening for the United Kingdom. For our beloved country Great Britain needs it desperately - a genuine Holy Spirit revival. May it come to pass Dear Father God through this Archbishop - Justin Welby.
<br> <br>
In the words God spoke directly to Billye Brim, an intercessor: “One thing will save America,(or even the United Kingdom).It is an awakening to God. One thing will avail for Israel and the nations. It is an awakening to God.”

       <h2>The Bishop of London, Richard Chartres will be&nbsp; preaching to a 
        two billion congregation!</h2> 
		
		<p class="main"><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC">&#39;The Christianity Magazine conducted a very interesting interview with the Rt. Honourable Richard Chartres: March 2012 Edition:
The Bishop wakes up at 5-30 am, and after a cup of tea he does morning prayers between 6 and 7 am from the Book of Common Prayer. He then prays for a further hour with the help of the Authorised Bible. This prayer discipline enables him to survive. He sees this as his bedrock as he falls into the 
        Hands of the Living God. This is an experience for him of the Power of God.
        Why do these sentiments encourage me tremendously spiritually? 
<br> 
       <img class="main" src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/daily/Chartres.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Richard Chartres">
       </p>
       
       
       
		<p class="main">
		Let us intensely pray for the current Bishop of London the Right Reverend Richard Chartres. He will be presenting the address (the sermon) at the Royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. It is forecasted that a global audience of 2 billion people will 
        be watching this marriage ceremony. Much more than the one billion who 
        watched the twenty/ twenty cricket final between India and Sri Lanka on 
        Saturday 2nd April 2011. We pray the anointing of the Holy Ghost, the 
        precious Presence of Jesus Christ (The Anointed One) will rest strongly 
        on the Rt. Honourable Dr. Richard John Carew Chartres. Our sentiments 
        are that every 
        single word he proclaims during the address will touch the inner spirit 
        of each global individual who will be watching the live telecast from Westminster Abbey on Friday 29 April 2011. May it be so, Father God. <br> <br>

        It is also encouraging to know that Richard Chartres is a great friend 
        of&nbsp; Rev. Nicky Gumbel, 
        (a former Barrister) who is the Vicar of Holy Trinity Brompton. They 
        initially got acquainted at Trinity College, Cambridge. At or around the 
        same time Prince Charles was an undergraduate at Trinity. Apparently this 
        is the largest Anglican 
church in Britain with a regular Sunday attendance of around 4,000 mostly young people.  He is the pioneer of the Alpha course, a 
15-session introduction to the Christian faith now running, Glory be to God, all over the 
world. We rejoice in the Godly connection between these two men. The factor
that excites me most about Nicky Gumbel is that whenever he is interviewed either
on Television or radio he always credits God the Holy Ghost for everything.<o:p></o:p></span> 
        Every alternate sentence or so God the Holy Ghost is credited. 
        Apparently all his Church services opens up with a solemn prayer: COME 
        HOLY SPIRIT. Our prayer is that all churches in the United Kingdom would 
        pray likewise. If you 
        are curious to know why the mention of the Holy Ghost tremendously excites Anton, then 
        do view the You Tube Production pasted below of Anton preaching in Malaysia.<br>
     <br>
On 11th June 2011, the O2 Arena, (Greenwich) has been booked to cater for 
        16,000 people to attend a worship service celebrating Pentecost. The 
        following Churches, Jesus House (Brent Cross, London, NW2), Hillsong( 
        Dominion Theatre<br>
Tottenham Court Road, London W1T) and Holy Trinity( Brompton Road, London)<br>
are 
        coming together in unity to worship God and pray for an outpouring of 
        the Holy Spirit.<br>
        There is a formidable team that is associated with Holy Trinity 
        Brompton. The organisation Worship Central runs its affairs from this 
        location. Tim Hughes, Al Gordon are all part of this team. Nicky and 
        Sila Lee are very involved in marriage courses /conferences and St. Paul`s 
        Theological Centre is based around this Church.<br>

<h2>
		&nbsp;Good Friday Service and Witness of a live Passion play 
        remembering what happened two thousand years ago. </h2>

	<p class="main">

After attending our very vibrant All Peckham Good Friday service at the Baptist 
Church we decided for the first time to witness a live performance of The 
passion of Jesus performed freely to the public in Trafalgar Square on 22 April 
2011.Two performances were held, one at 12 noon and the other at 3-15 pm. There 
was a very big screen and wonderful acoustics. On reflection it was magnificently performed; and very moving. It might be on next year again. We exhort you not to miss it!! What a delight to see the very Bishop of London himself giving the final benediction. Well done Dr. Richard John Chartres. Just one recommendation, it would have been a sheer blessing, if we could have concluded the anointed drama with the LORDS PRAYER- THE OUR FATHER.
 <br> <br><h2>


On 29th April 2011 The Bishop of London proclaimed this message: Herewith I am 
pasting his sermon preached to a world wide congregation at the Royal Wedding. 
Brethren, I 
sense our prayers were answered.</h2>
       
 <p class="main">
 <font style="background-color:#FFFFCC"> His opening words were:
<b> 
"Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire." </b>
<br> <br>
So said St Catherine of Siena whose festival day this is. Marriage is intended to be a way in 
 which man and woman help each other to become what God meant each one to be, 
 their deepest and truest selves.
</font>
 <br>
 <br>
 Many people are fearful for the future of today’s world but the message of the 
 celebrations in this country and far beyond its shores is the right one – this 
 is a joyful day! It is good that people in every continent are able to share in 
 these celebrations because this is, as every wedding day should be, a day of 
 hope. <br>
 <br>
 In a sense every wedding is a royal wedding with the bride and groom as king 
 and queen of creation, making a new life together so that life can flow through 
 them into the future. <br>
 <br>
 William and Catherine, you have chosen to be married in the sight of a generous 
 God who so loved the world that he gave himself to us in the person of Jesus 
 Christ. <br>
 <br>
 In the Spirit of this generous God, husband and wife are to give themselves to 
 each other. <br>
 <br>
 The spiritual life grows as love finds its centre beyond ourselves. Faithful 
 and committed relationships offer a door into the mystery of spiritual life in 
 which we discover this: the more we give of self, the richer we become in soul; 
 the more we go beyond ourselves in love, the more we become our true selves and 
 our spiritual beauty is more fully revealed. In marriage we are seeking to 
 bring one another into fuller life. <br>
 <br>
 It is of course very hard to wean ourselves away from self-centredness. People 
 can dream of such a thing but that hope should not be fulfilled without a 
 solemn decision that, whatever the difficulties, we are committed to the way of 
 generous love. <br>
 <br>
 You have both made your decision today – “I will” – and by making this new 
 relationship, you have aligned yourselves with what we believe is the way in 
 which life is spiritually evolving, and which will lead to a creative future 
 for the human race. <br>
 <br>
 We stand looking forward to a century which is full of promise and full of 
 peril. Human beings are confronting the question of how to use wisely the power 
 that has been given to us through the discoveries of the last century. We shall 
 not be converted to the promise of the future by more knowledge, but rather by 
 an increase of loving wisdom and reverence, for life, for the earth and for one 
 another. <br>
 <br>
 Marriage should transform, as husband and wife make one another their work of 
 art. It is possible to transform so long as we do not harbour ambitions to 
 reform our partner. There must be no coercion if the Spirit is to flow; each 
 must give the other space and freedom. Chaucer, the London poet, sums it up in 
 a pithy phrase: <br>
 <br>
 &quot;Whan maistrie [mastery] comth, <br>
 the God of Love anon, <br>
 Beteth his wynges, and farewell, <br>
 he is gon.&quot; <br>
 <br>
 As the reality of God has faded from so many lives in the West, there has been 
 a corresponding inflation of expectations that personal relations alone will 
 supply meaning and happiness in life. This is to load our partner with too 
 great a burden. We are all incomplete: we all need the love which is secure, 
 rather than oppressive. We need mutual forgiveness in order to thrive. <br>
 <br>
 As we move towards our partner in love, following the example of Jesus Christ, 
 the Holy Spirit is quickened within us and can increasingly fill our lives with 
 light. This leads on to a family life which offers the best conditions in which 
 the next generation can receive and exchange those gifts which can overcome 
 fear and division and incubate the coming world of the Spirit, whose fruits are 
 love and joy and peace. <br>
 <br>
 I pray that all of us present and the many millions watching this ceremony and 
 sharing in your joy today will do everything in their power to support and 
 uphold you in your new life. I pray that God will bless you in the way of life 
 you have chosen. That way which is expressed in the prayer that you have 
 composed together in preparation for this day: <br>
 <br>
 God our Father, we thank you for our families; for the love that we share and 
 for the joy of our marriage. <br>
 In the busyness of each day keep our eyes fixed on what is real and important 
 in life and help us to be generous with our time and love and energy. <br>
 Strengthened by our union help us to serve and comfort those who suffer. <br>
 We ask this in the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Amen. </span>

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>
        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.
