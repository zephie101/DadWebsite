		<h2>Prophecy -For the year 2007</h2> 
		<h3>My prayer: May our Gracious Father Extend His Hand of Mercy on us all <br>
		Posted 26 November 2006 at 9-11 pm
		</h3>
		<p class="main">
		There will be periods of intense sorrow and incredible challenges but hold steady for your compassionate God through His Gracious Spirit 
		will awake you in the early hours of the morning and will give you precise instructions to pray. 
		During this precious time of your awakening you might ask how do I commence my prayer. 
		At that moment remember the Lord’s Prayer,
		<br> <br>
		<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b> Matthew 6:9-13 </b> <br>
9 "This, then, is how you should pray: <br>
" 'Our Father in heaven, <br>
hallowed be your name, <br>
10 your kingdom come, <br>
your will be done <br>
on earth as it is in heaven. <br>
11 Give us today our daily bread. <br>
12 Forgive us our debts, <br>
as we also have forgiven our debtors. <br>
13 And lead us not into temptation, <br>
but deliver us from the evil one <br>
</FONT> <br> <br>
Keep on praying the Lords Prayer and you will realize, discern and recognize the spirit of intercession and supplication has overshadowed you and then
the Presence of God Himself will elevate you to a higher dimension and you will begin to groan loudly the exact prayer of the Spirit.
This form of prayer will recharge you and you will find praying such an exciting and joyful experience.
<br> <br>
This also will be the year of the purging of the Body of Christ especially Pastors,
Lay leaders and teachers of the Word who have not interlinked their preaching with the practical application in their lives. They will be exposed for their dead works.
The initial beginnings of the Refiners fire will be felt and seen we will not be able to avoid this purging.
No man or woman will be able to stop this supernatural work of the Spirit.
<br> <br>
Yet through all this the Spirit of our Lord will be joyfully radiated on all those who obeyed the voice of the 
Lord God in regard to deeply meditating on the Word of God and than interceding, supplicating and groaning through the Spirit.
This will be the remnant who will move forward and these verses of our Lord will be fully manifested and will be seen to operate in their lives
for they will witness the answer to their prayers in fulfilling the greater works of our Lord.
<br> <br>
		<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>John 14:12-14</b> <br>
12 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. <br>
13 And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <br>
14 If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.

    <h2>Prophecy for 2006/2007 and onwards discharged</h2>
    <h3>By Anton Nicholas to discern, pray and then hearken <br>
    Let the Words take residence in you <br>
    Posted 31 December 2005 at 2-11 pm
    </h3>
		<p class="main">
		Develop an intimacy with our Lord Jesus Christ - at a spiritual level of depth and height that has never occurred before in your prayer life.
		This intimacy must exceed all previous spiritual endeavours.
		Dig and dig deep into the Word of our Lord - The Word of Life. It is in this intimacy your peace will be secured.
		<br> <br>
		<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b> Psalm 91:1 </b> <br>
HE who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall remain stable and fixed under the shadow of the Almighty [Whose power no foe can withstand].
</FONT> <br> <br>
He is a Divinely jealous God. For His love for you is passionate.
He is observing the various distractions and obstacles that are coming in between that is, stopping this intimacy from developing.
<br> <br>
In 2006 onwards you must surrender yourself completely, for this is the only way the peace of your spirit, soul, body and mind are assured, 
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">given what is going to take place on the face of this earth.</FONT>
Do not let any event or circumstance distract you from your sole objective, which is to love God, Our Lord Jesus in His entirety and to expand the Kingdom of God fully.
<br> <br>
For you need to reinforce as a solid foundation our Lord’s peace within you.
It’s a foundation that must be permanently secured- if not adversities and afflictions when they (surely) come along will overwhelm you and the
peace of the Lord within you will be shaken and your intimacy with our Lord will be strained.
<br> <br>
Each of us will experience a circumstance that is something out of the ordinary way of life which will be a direct challenge to the peace of the Living God in our lives.
This is the reason why the peace of Jesus within us must be established on concrete stone and absolutely nothing must shake the foundation.
From 2006/2007 onwards instill layer upon layer of the Word of Truth within your spirit.
The distractions will be intense and immense, the obstacles will be heart wrenching and heart wresting and yet the 
peace of Jesus which will be transplanted within you will be a supernatural work of God the Holy Ghost.
This will carry you through and the world will see and observe and take notice and they will be drawn towards you in their great numbers
and they will enquire of you on how do you maintain this peace.
Then my brother, my sister the anointing will manifest itself through you and from you and than the opportunity will arise to share the 
Good News of the King of Kings, Jesus Christ, emboldened by the testimony within you and protected by the Precious Blood of the Risen Saviour, you will be a shining star for our Heavenly Father.
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b> Hosea 2:14-15,19-20 </b> <br> 
14 Therefore, I am going to persuade her, <br>
lead her to the wilderness, <br>
and speak tenderly to her. <br>
15 There I will give her vineyards back to her <br>
and make the Valley of Achor <br>
into a gateway of hope ... <br>
19 And I will betroth you to Me forever; yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and justice, in steadfast love, and in mercy. <br>
20 I will even betroth you to Me in stability and in faithfulness, and you shall know (recognize, be acquainted with, appreciate, give heed to, and cherish) the Lord.

    <h2>This prayer prophecy thrills my spirit</h2> 
		<p class="main">
	One of the first “Charismatic” books I read when I arrived in London, was a book entitled, Heaven Here I Come by Jean Darnall.
	It was a fascinating book to read about how Jean’s mother called Grace died and went up to Heaven. Jean went down on her knees and implored our Lord to bring her mother back.
	In Heaven Jesus told Grace that He has got to answer Jean’s prayers and He will send Grace back to her daughter.
	When Grace came back to life again, she asked her daughter Jean, "Why did you bring me back?"
	<br> <br>
Jean Darnall has countless times laid hands and prayed for me. I know this precious lady, for she and her husband Elmer tutored me at Christian Life College, Kennington, London.
<br> <br>
I would like to post here a prophecy she uttered under the anointing of the Holy Ghost. Please do read it prayerfully. It has got to come to pass. This prophecy thrills my spirit.
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b> Posted 11 March 2005 <br>
Men at Prayer</b> <br> 
There are three things that the Lord has asked me to share about this vision everywhere I go: three signs of this awakening.
The first is that the Lord is sending a strong call to prayer among men.
Early Morning Prayer meetings will start all over the land as men desire to pray, and they will start asking their pastors and leaders, 'Can we meet together before work and pray?'
In those prayer meetings there will come strong intercession and an increased faith and vision in these men's souls for the nation.
They will not only pray in their own churches, but soon they will start combining together in other churches, with other church groups.
And in some places these prayer meetings will grow too big for the building, and they will come out in the open and pray in the parks or in front of town halls.
<br> <br>
Wouldn't that be nice, to have a prayer meeting right out here, of hundreds and hundreds of men lifting their voices in prayer for the nation?
And it will be a sign in itself: these prayer meetings will be a witness to the nation, and many people will come to the Lord just by witnessing these prayer meetings,
and hearing the prayers of these men.

		<h2>We are living in the age of the Overflow: 2005 onwards</h2> 
		<p class="main">
	One individual will be under a Divine blessing, (experiencing the overflow of the cup of blessing, Deuteronomy 28, verses 1-14),
	whilst at the same time another individual will be under Divine judgement.
	<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b> Galatians 6:7</b><br>
7 Do not be deceived and deluded and misled; God will not allow Himself to be sneered at (scorned, disdained, or mocked by mere pretensions or professions, or by His precepts being set aside.)
[He inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God.] <br> <br>
<b>For whatever a man sows, that and that only is what he will reap</b>
</FONT> <br> <br>
Two men of God spoke the following words to each other prophetically, (Brethren test it out in prayer)
<br> <br>
<b> He gave many, many years for people to repent. Now, He’s no less merciful than He ever was. He’s not out of mercy, but he’s out of time.</b>
 This thing is going to come out exactly on the time He has chosen. It’s going to be the exact second he has chosen. Matthew 24, The Father knows the time!
 <br> <br>
All this words stands on a certain post, the words of Jesus,: "Thou shall love --- " and this is in order, by the way.
" 'Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and great commandment.
The second is like unto it, 'Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.' On these two commandments hang all of the law and the Prophets."

		 <h2>I listened to his teaching tapes attentively and partook of the anointing on Derek Prince's life.</h2> 
            <p class="main">
            These quotes below are the words of the late Derek Prince.
            He was an anointed teacher of the Word of God.
            During the 1970s and the 1980s I read some of his books and listened attentively to a good amount of his teaching tapes.
            It was also a great joy to support Derek Prince Ministries---a world-wide ministry. His books are also sold in Malaysia.
            The words below come from a man who is sensitive to the voice of God the Holy Ghost.
            <br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5">Derek Prince in <i>Through the Psalms</i><br>
            <b>
"<b>No matter how great the pressures,</b> we must continually cultivate an inner stillness that permits us to hear what God is saying.
He is telling us: “<b>I have foreknown all that you see around you.</b> I am not unprepared. When all my purposes have ripened, I will intervene. <b>Do not give way to fear.</b>
 The situation is not out of control. Ultimately all will work out for My glory and for your good.”
