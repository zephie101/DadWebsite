<h2> Follow up to prophecy 2010 </h2>
  

<h3> 8 June 2009  </h3>

<p class="side1" align="left">


We thank God The Father that in the European Elections results, announced a few minutes ago,
that the Christian Party-Christian Peoples Alliance managed to receive 232,755 votes which is equivalent to 1.7% of votes cast.
The Name of Jesus Christ was unashamedly mentioned on the fairly long list balloting paper.
This party made British electoral history as this was the first time that a Christian party had run in every region of the UK.
Do note that in London the Christian party picked up 51,336 votes - 2.9% of the vote -For in 2004 the votes were 45,038. This party is beginning to make a shade of an impact.
<br> <br> 
For the unprecedented breaking news at an incredible pace in 2010 will either shake or strengthen your intercessory spirit.

<h2> Prophecy for 2009</h2>
<h3>
A year to be dedicated to our Great and Faithful Friend: God The Holy Ghost <br>
Prophecy posted 16th July 2008 at 8-30 pm
</h3>
</p>
<p class="side1" align="left">
Brethren in 2009, practice  within all your being saturating, soaking and covering yourself with anointed praying until it becomes an indwelling habit pattern.
We ought by now have become prayer specialists. Trained and skilled to combat spiritual warfare. For the forces of darkness are masquerading themselves through a spirit of tangible fear.
After you have prayed for yourself cover your whole family in prayer, this form of praying is mandatory for 2009.
<br> <br> 
If for a justified reason we are not in a position to soak and pray then just kneel and humble ourselves before Our Lord and declare openly and loudly that
Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and cover ourselves and our families with the blood of the resurrected Saviour.
Where fear prevails we have got to overload ourselves with faith, prayerfully meditating on the Word of God.
Oh, you need to develop a tremendous intimacy with God The Holy Ghost, do not detract from this gracious and loving relationship!
We have got to be spiritually alert for His specific instructions. The world will take note that you are carrying within you the radiant fire of the Holy Ghost.
<br> <br>
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Colossians 4:2</b> <br>
Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful, and pray ... that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ.
</FONT> <br> <br>
Pray and decree that in 2009 this prophetic utterance will come to pass that every Church in the United Kingdom who is having an on going and fruitful relationship with our
Loving Father and who is following the final instructions of our Lord Jesus to the dot, found in the verses below:
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Matthew 28:16-20</b> <br>
The Great Commission  <br>
16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. <br>
17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. <br>
18 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <br>
19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit <br>
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
</FONT> <br> <br>
Pray that the Churches will follow on to be obedient to the urgent call of the Holy Spirit to call their congregation to pray as a body in accordance to:
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>2 Chronicles 7:14</b> <br>
"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
</FONT> <br> <br>
We need to woo the people of Great Britain back to the bible believing Churches and this will only take place once we get the believers to pray and intercede.
<br> <br>
<b> 2009 will be a year totally dedicated to the 3rd person of the Blessed Trinity, God The Holy Spirit or as I prefer to call Him, God The Holy Ghost.</b>
Read, study, pray through, reflect, meditate and seek the revelation of the gems found within the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.
The Holy Ghost is stirring and instructing me to read and prayerfully reflect on all the 28 chapters of the Acts of the Apostles and the gospel of John, all 21 chapters.
The instruction is to read each verse, each line and each chapter 30 times through, paying particular attention whenever God The Holy Spirit is mentioned.
(I will follow this instruction faithfully, Father God.)
<br> <br>
God The Father is going to activate The Holy Spirit within us to perform miraculous signs and wonders and to speak to the nations of the world to come back to the embrace of His Son,
Our Lord Jesus Christ. 
For His Hands are still open and I see a vision of the cross and He is saying, My love for each of you knows no measure.
In the summer of 2008 as the glittering Olympics begins in Beijing, China, you will begin to hear and witness a glimpse of this in China to what the Holy Spirit will be doing in the year 2009.
It's just a dress rehearsal. As the opening of the Olympics will indeed be spectacular so will the manifestation of God The Holy Ghost be mightily glorious.
No authority or regime will be able to stop this.
This surely will be a move of the Living God and no human individual will be able to take credit of this Divine Activity.
You might ask what prompted this move of The Holy Spirit, the answer is the prayers, intercessions, the supplications,
the fasting and the seeking of the face of God by millions and millions of the redeemed body of Christ all over the world.
Especially the intercession that took place on some prayer strategic days, like the world global day of prayer and The Call solemn Assemblies. 
<br> <br>
God the Holy Ghost will make an appearance during the Olympic festivities, for he has received an invitation to do so through the powerful prayer of the intercessors.
For the Chinese high command has not offered Him, (Our Beloved Friend)  an official invite!!!
<br> <br>
God The Holy Spirit will be actively moving behind the scene in China as billions of people from all over the world will be focused to their television sets to spectate all the live drama,
the fine achievements of the athletes and the wide variety of all the other spectacular Olympic events.
Yet through all this God The Holy Ghost is going to show forth His awesome power, spectacular signs and wonders, miraculous interventions,
the Christian message is going to be preached boldly and many in China are going to receive a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost.
To witness this Divine event will be something magnificent to observe!!!
<br> <br>
Some of these beloved Chinese Christians empowered by the Holy Ghost will move out of China as bold evangelists and missionaries.
The first nation that is going to receive the spiritual benefit of this outpouring will be the nation of India and then it will make its way into the nation of Bhutan and Nepal.
God The Holy Spirit will begin to stir a spiritual awakening in the nation of Burma. (Republic of the Union of Myanmar)
<br> <br>
Meanwhile, daily  Brethren continue to confess this scripture like a warrior as though you are engaged in hand to hand combat:
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Psalm 122:6</b> <br>
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
"May they prosper who love you."
</FONT> <br> <br>
Please do take heed to this: During 2009 follow every principle, precept and instruction of the following verses - 
<b>This is essential for your life to be under the preservation power of God The Holy Ghost. </b>
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Ephesians 4:30-32</b> <br>
30 And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption. <br>
31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour. <br>
32 Instead, be kind to each other, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.
</FONT> <br> <br>

The pink flowers are Rhododendrons, the plant on the right  is called Flaming Silver and Pansies in the foreground.

<h2> Prophecy for 2008 </h2>
<h3> Dear Holy Spirit, grant us an interpretation to the signs of the times.
<br> <br>
Pray fervently, pray regularly, pray diligently, pray all the time. <br>
You will know why soon!
<br> <br>

</p>
<p class="side1" align="left">
This year at the rising of the dawn do utter this scriptural verses as part of your prayer strategy.
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Psalm 122:6-9</b> <br>
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: <br>
"May they prosper who love you. <br>
7 Peace be within your walls, <br>
Prosperity within your palaces." <br>
8 FOR THE SAKE OF MY BRETHREN AND COMPANIONS, <br>
I WILL NOW SAY, "PEACE BE WITHIN YOU." <br>
9 BECAUSE OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD OUR GOD <br>
I WILL SEEK YOUR GOOD. <br>
</FONT> <br> <br>
These two truths are parallel for what will take place in Israel will have a domino effect on every nation on the face of this earth.
<br> <br>
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> Whilst you are saturating these verses into your spirit at the same time for the sake of your family and your Church get your finances in order.
</FONT>
Follow strictly the economic principles/ system of the Kingdom of God through sowing and reaping.
<br> <br>
Meditate on:
<br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Malachi 3:10-12</b> <br>
10 "BRING ALL THE TITHES into the storehouse, <br>
That there may be food in My house, <br>
And try Me now in this," <br>
Says the LORD of hosts, <br>
"See if I will not open for you the windows of heaven <br>
AND POUR OUT FOR YOU SUCH BLESSING <br>
that there will not be room enough to receive it. <br>
11 "AND I WILL REBUKE THE DEVOURER FOR YOUR SAKES,  <br>
So that he will not destroy the fruit of your ground, <br>
Nor shall the vine fail to bear fruit for you in the field," <br>
Says the LORD of hosts; <br>
12 And all nations will call you blessed, <br>
For you will be a delightful land," <br>
Says the LORD of hosts
</FONT> <br> <br>
Resist the Devourer, by applying the Precious Blood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth on your family, your business, your job, your travel , your home, your neighbourhood.
The devourer must not touch your family in any shape or form. To enhance this apply the principles of the two scriptures above.
<br> <br>
Pray fervently, pray regularly, pray diligently, pray all the time. You will know why soon! Our Precious Lord will throw forth this challenge on you: As it is written, 
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Romans 10:15b</b> <br>
"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
</FONT> <br> <br>
Be alert, sharpen your spiritual ears, you will hear at various places of the glorious manifestation of the Presence of God.
This will affect every continent.
People of various ethnic origins, different religious faiths will testify they have seen Jesus and will speak with joyful tears of His manifested Glory.
Then they will see you and perceive and observe through their spiritual eyes that you are carrying within you the shining star of Jesus - 
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> this will be the prepared moment, the exact moment for you to preach and teach the GOOD NEWS OF JESUS.
</FONT> Go and visit these places where you will sense and feel the Glorious Presence of God. For the media will be interested in this news too!
<br> <br> <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>
2008 is a year of impact. </FONT> </b>
<br> <br>
Whilst this Glory will tremendously impact you other incidences will happen which will also have an impact on you - in regard to these other incidences remember the words of the Apostle Paul
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Romans 8:35,37-39</b> <br>
35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <br>
37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <br>
38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers <br>
39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</FONT> <br> <br>
Than look forward with radiance to witness this: <br>
<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <b>Revelations 5:13-14</b> <br>
13 Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing: <br>
"To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb <br>
be praise and honour and glory and power, <br>
for ever and ever!" <br>
14) The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.
</FONT> <br> <br>
Supplementary Notes to assist us in praying:
<br> <br>
a) I read a commentary today, 26th October 2007 that President George Bush recently made an emergency request to the Democratic majority Congress.
He wants an emergency war chest funding amounting to $190 billion.
An additional $88 billion has been specifically requested by the Defense department.
They want this specific additional amount to be used to modify the sophisticated stealth bombers so they could carry a special armament: a 30,000 pound bomb called the massive ordinance penetrator.
Iran has declared a number of times that if there are any attacks to disrupt their nuclear plans then they have strategically placed long range missiles to be launched (destination unknown).
They have also planted secret commando units around the globe.
<br> <br>
b) Its elections in America next year, 2008.
If you do have a second to spare please do say an anointed prayer for the American Presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee a former Baptist Minister and he was also the 44th Governor of Arkansas.
The United States of America certainly needs an individual as President with strong Christian convictions and Mike Huckabee has a formidable Christian foundation.
<br> <br>
In 2008 we have to humble ourselves and land on our knees and pray, intercede and cry out to our Lord.
<br> <br>
Every Blessing my dear Brethren.
