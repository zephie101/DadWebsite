<h2> Four Blood Moons </h2>
  

<h3> Four Blood Moons:<br>Are these Divine Prophetic signs/ indicators for us to prepare for forthcoming events? <br>
Do you recognise the Hebrew Word Shemitah, ‘shmita’?<br> <br>
This means release- to let go in a particular year. There has been a heavy discourse over this particular word for the last few years amongst the Christian literati.<br> <br>
When China devalued their currency Yuan on 11th August 2015,( devalued on three occasions within a week) the other Asian Markets ‘sneezed’. Millions of dollars’ worth of foreign funds were pulled out of stock markets in the region.</b>
<br> <br>
In order to pray we need to keep abreast of ‘Live Events’ breaking news.<br> <br>Some have already occured and the other news breaking items are scheduled to take place soon.<br>Keep a close eye on the contents of this article.

<h2>We heard Pastor John Hagee presenting a talk about what are Blood Moons.<br> <br>John Charles Hagee is the Senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas,USA.<br>A non-denominational Charismatic megachurch with more than 20,000 active members. Pastor John Hagee is also the Chief Executive Officer of Global Evangelism Television.</h2>

 He said that our God who created the sun, moon and stars controls them exactly to the split second and He is sending us signals and signs.<br> <br> Keep a close look out for these critical signals.<br> <br> He states that Four Blood moons occurring in rapid succession has only happened 3 times in over 500 years.<br> <br> On each of these occasions there has been something very dramatic involving the Jewish people.Presently pertaining to the Nation of Israel.
<font style="background-color:#FFFFCC" size="5">
<h2>The historical facts are these.</h2>

<p class="main">
</font>
The 1st Blood Moon was in 1492 - The Jewish people were expelled from Spain. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella gave an explicit edit of expulsion for the Jews to leave Spain in 14 days. They were to leave all their possessions and their real estate. They were only allowed to take what they could carry. Many gave away their children to Christian families so that they would have a chance to live. As the Jewish people were climbing on to leaky ships headed to the sea and death, coincidentally the ship of Christopher Columbus passed by on its way to seek a new land, where the Jewish people and all people seeking freedom could live which would be called America.<br> <br> 
The 2nd Blood moon occurred in 1948-The formation for the nation of Israel. After 2000 years of tragedy the Jewish people end their exile, and Israel becomes a reality.<br> <br>
The 3rd Blood moon happened in 1967-The 6 day war in which Jerusalem again became the capital of the State of Israel.<br> <br>
 Do note the tragedy/triumphant scenarios.<br>
In 1492 there was the edit of expulsion and the discovery of America.<br><br>
In 1948 there were the 7 years of living hell of the holocaust then the reality of a Zionist Statehood.<br><br>
In 1967 there was the 6 day war then there was the unification of the city of Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the State of Israel.<br>

<h2> A Prophetic Word for 2016.Anton delivered a eulogy at his Dad's farewell service, 18th April 2015, in Klang, Selangor,West Malaysia. 
<br> Meditate on these scriptures for 2016 <br> 
	Posted 10 July 2015. </h2>
<font style="background-color: #FFFFCC">
<p class="main">		
Under a strict Vatican ruling the eulogy should not have lasted longer than five minutes under the Pastoral guidance of the local Parish Priest. Thank God the former Bishop of Penang was kind to him. Anton spoke for more than thirteen minutes. He broke all conventions! Hear the eulogy on this video and find out why he spoke under such a burden. Within the talk he sensed and spoke a prophetic word for the year 2016: Please surrender your life totally to Christ Jesus.

<br> <br> 
<b> The solemn words of our Lord Jesus to you: <br>
Revelations Chapter 3 verse 20:<br> </b>
 'I am now standing at the door and am knocking. If any one listens to My voice and opens the door, I will go in to be with him and will feast with him, and he shall feast with Me.
<br> <br>
<b>
 Luke Chapter 10 verse 41-42: <br></b>
"Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. <br>
<font style="color: #A62A2A">
Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.” </font> <br> <br>
 <b> How does one live in the centre of God’s Will? </b>
A) Make a decisive dedication of your body to the Lord.<font style="color: #A62A2A">
 Romans 12 verse 1: Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.</font> <br> <br>
Make the decision to bring your body into obedience to the New Man within you.<br> <br>
<font style="color: #A62A2A">
B) Ephesians 4 verse 15: But, holding the truth in love, we may grow up to Him in all things, who is the Head, the Christ.</font> <br> <br>
Growth is the goal of the Christian. Focus and zero in. Be Heavenly minded. Take on the nature of Jesus.
<font style="color: #A62A2A">
 Psalm 73 verse 25:  Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee<br> <br> Psalm 105 verse 4 : Seek the LORD and the strength He gives! Seek His presence continually!</font>

 Seriously engage with this above 6 minute short video clip for in 2015 the forces of hell want to vent and manifest their fury.<br> <br> The spiritual battle has already commenced.<br> <br> It is not a battle between nations, people, religion or ethnicity. It is actually a vicious battle between Kingdoms. It is Kingdom against Kingdom.<br> <br> The anointed videos will encourage you on how to be ready. It is compelling viewing. Keep the faith strong.<br> <br>At the end of the video clip there is an urgent <b>prayer request</b> to pray specifically for Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the forthcoming elections in the United Kingdom and the Presidential Elections in the United States of America. (Even a 5 minute prayer will be a sweet fragrance to the Throne Room.)</font> <br> <br>
