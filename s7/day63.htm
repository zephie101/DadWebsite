Psalm 2 verse 5: Then in anger He rebukes them, terrifying them with His fierce fury. 6) For the Lord declares, “I have placed My chosen king on the throne in Jerusalem, on My holy mountain.” <br> <br>

So it is not the Supreme Court, nor Congress or the work of any man or woman but solely the Holy Ghost who is going to triumph in the life of President Donald J Trump. Thank you Jesus.<br> <br>

Zechariah 4 v6: "So he answered me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of Armies."<br> <br>

Friday 25th December 2020: The onslaught has commenced. President Trump's enemies strengthened by demonic power will begin to have their downfall now. When we celebrate the birthday of Jesus one by one of his enemies will collapse under the glorious power of the Living God.

     </b><br> <br>
Tuesday 12th January 2021. There needs to be an Elijah moment. They are mocking the Prophets. The world and many Christians are asking where is God in this moment. Why are the fraudulent activities not exposed? God answered the Prophet Elijah's prayer by fire.<br> <br> 6th January 2021.</b> One can observe that many have given up on Donald J Trump continuing to being President of the United States of America. Approximately 250,000 Patriots gathered to assemble peacefully in Washington D. C.<br>Trespassing the halls of Congress broke the hearts of many Patriots. (Although I have my own personal opinion/ conviction who these intruders could be). <br> <br> At around 8pm London time I went through a powerful and tangible sense of what a  mother experiences when she is heavily pregnant. Like the waters have broken and the baby is coming forth soon. No one but no one can stop the baby from coming forth. It is imminent. I sense many anointed men and women of God are receiving images of this nature.<br> This is the hour, the moment when a birthing is going to take place and it will manifest soon on the Presidential life of Donald J Trump.</b><br> <br> A majority of individuals whom Donald J Trump helped to secure their various political positions have now totally betrayed him.<br> <br> When this unstoppable birthing process takes place, God the Father will show to Donald J Trump that The Lord Almighty will never betray him. We will quietly wait and see this mighty & miraculous process taking place. <br> <br> In fact I identify very closely with this birthing story given what has happened to us over these last few months. We witnessed two babies coming forth with the mothers having a difficult delivery with complications involved. After a very long labour the respective babies came forth. This is what is happening now in America. It is a protracted labour process but the victory is coming soon.
<br> <br>

<b>Within the above context I feel led to insert this powerful prayer today Monday 18th January 2021 displayed below provided by Dutch Sheets Ministries. </b> <br> <br> Thank you Jesus that more than 200,000 individuals will be imploring this prayer all over the world. I genuinely believe this is a very strategic prayer that will invade the Heavenly atmosphere. Please do join us and pray this prayer loudly.<br> <br>On our part we will pray this below inserted Prayer every day.<br> <br>

Please could you include Mike Lindell and his family in your prayers. May the Precious Powerful Blood of Jesus and His Holy Angels protect them all. May God the Father mightily prosper his 'My Pillow Company.'<br> <br>

We need the video released today, Friday 5th February 2021 at 3pm GMT to be viewed by millions of people. <b>Access this significant video on OAN- One America News Network. Mike Lindell’s ABSOLUTE PROOF.</b>

<br> <br> Mike Lindell is indeed a powerful warrior.<br> <br>

"So Lord God Almighty, the Lord of the Armies of Heaven, I thank you for the Power of the Blood of Yeshua, Jesus, over all witchcraft and occult.<br> <br>

We come before You now covered by the Blood of Jesus Christ and proclaim over the worldwide systems of evil seeking to take control in America and in the nations.<br> <br>

Let the occult shields of protection be taken away from everyone involved in theft, fraud, and corruption.<br> <br>

May their occult shields of protection no longer be able to hide them from being exposed by the light.<br> <br>

Let witchcraft manipulation be brought to an end in and over the Congress, Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court, the FBI, the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Pentagon and over the state executives, courts and legislatures, and over election integrity.<br> <br>

As Joshua and Caleb proclaimed to the Hebrews intimidated by the giants, we say to all who are intimidated by today’s giants,<br> <br>
‘...do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them...their protection is gone...their protection is gone...their protection is gone...but the Lord is with us...Do not be afraid of them.’ (Numbers 14:9)<br> <br>
“We proclaim this in the mighty Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Amen.” <br> <br>

<b> Psalm 55:<br> <br> v 12) It is not an enemy who taunts me—
    then I could bear it;<br> <br>
it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me—
    then I could hide from him.<br> <br>
13) But it is you, my equal,
    my companion, my familiar friend.
14) We used to hold sweet converse together;
    within God’s house we walked in fellowship.<br> <br> <b>2 Timothy 4:16-18</b><br><br>
16) At my first defense no one took my part; all deserted me. May it not be charged against them!<br> <br>

17) But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength to proclaim the word fully, that all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion’s mouth.<br> <br>

18) The Lord will rescue me from every evil and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<b><u>28th August 1995.</b></u> <br> <br>
It was on this day 25 years ago that my Dear Mum Jeyamani Theresa Nicholas was called to Heaven to be with Our Lord Jesus Christ.<br> <br>
My inspiring Mum’s story is on this below mentioned link: Worth a read:<br>

Born at 10-50 pm to our son Paul and our daughter-in - law Gloria at St. Thomas’ Hospital London, UK.
Our granddaughter was determined to be born on this auspicious day. We know for we were kept up to date with the stages of the childbirth.<br> <br>
For 25 years, every year we remembered incredible memories of my Dear Mum. The date 28th August always reminded us of my late Mum.<br> <br>
 On 28th August 2020 our granddaughter comes into being and brings tremendous joy to us.<br> <br>
There is a message therein between life and death. For Life and death are in the Hands of Our Lord.

We are all interconnected. Heaven & Earth.
Thank you, Jesus.<br> <br>

 *3rd March 2020* the Prophets & Intercessors have declared as a Global day of prayer and fasting.We desperately need  our mighty, God the Father to intervene supernaturally resist & annihilate this death infested plague released by the Kingdom of darkness.<br> <br>1. *Pray* *Psalm* *91* over your families and nations.“When we live our lives within the shadow of God Most High, our secret hiding place, we will always be shielded from harm. HOW THEN COULD EVIL PREVAIL AGAINST US OR DISEASE INFECT US?” (Passion Translation, Ps. 91:9-10)<br> <br>2. The prophets are concerned that *fear* is spreading in *epidemic* proportions in our nations. Therefore during this prayer time, we want to both pray against fear and remind ourselves that God has not given us a spirit of fear. “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind” (2 Tim. 1:7).<br> <br>3. Because fear can cause us to also make reactionary or unwise decisions, we pray for wisdom for our leaders to contain the spread of the virus while protecting their people effectively. We pray also for the crisis response teams and emergency responders in each nation to be protected and be effective.<br> <br>Two aspects of fear were identified—the fear of the contagious disease itself and the fear of lack. The fear of lack can cause economies to collapse and people to move into individual survivalism. Pray that the Lord will give individuals wisdom from Heaven during this season rather than becoming reactionary in self-protection.<br> <br>For this reason we feel this is a wake-up call that we are a global church, and that the challenges affecting other nations truly affect us all. Pray for the nations as we pray for our own!If you have been complacent about praying for other nations suffering from this virus, we encourage a time of reflection and repentance.<br> <br>4. Across the world people are being faced with the *greatest* *fear* *known* *to* *mankind* —the prospect of our own *mortality* . Pray for courage for believers to share Jesus Christ effectively through this time of crisis.<br><br>5. Many prophetic voices across the world have been prophesying the coming of the *next* *great* *awakening* , and that it will happen on a worldwide scale. Forces of evil would like to use this to either delay or disrupt the coming awakenings and revivals. Intercede that this will not happen, but rather escalate the moves of God worldwide. God wants this season to turn into a catalyst of revival instead of contagion.<br> <br>“The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10 NKJV).<br> <br>6. Make a decree that this coronavirus plague will cease worldwide, and that that God will heal all who are currently affected by it.<br> <br>7. Reconsecrate yourselves, your families, and your nation to God through the taking of communion. Remember the miracle of Passover. Plead and apply the blood of the Lamb on the doorposts of your spheres.<br> <br>Thank you & thank you Jesus.</h3><br> <br></u>

We are lovingly calling Christians to do everything possible within their means to get involved in a Praise and Prayer meeting where the Presence of the Holy Ghost is active and real. Remember The Acts of the Apostles.
<br> <br>
This is an urgent matter for our safety, security and stability.
Please take heed!
<br> <br>
 Acts 4:13-'Now when they saw the boldness of Peter & John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marvelled. And they realised that they had been with Jesus.
 <br> <br>
Acts 4:33 and with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.

            The counter below was introduced for the first time on <FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <i> <b>8th January 2014.</b> </i> </font>Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago,and filled it with exciting statistics,suddenly went out of business.As a result we lost all our treasured statistics. <br> <br>

We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again,<FONT style="background-color:#FEF1B5"> <i> <b>(January 2014)</b> </i> </font>  through another firm.It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth!

        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from 

        Christ&#39;s College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005. Paul is 

        pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family 

        member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left. 

		<p class="side">

        Paul attained&nbsp; his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also 

        awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br> <br> The further 

        exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.

        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle 

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> Benedict Ponniah </b> </a>

        , who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.

        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).

        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm" style="color:#003F87"> <b> The conditions are steep for Jannine </b> </a>

         she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.
