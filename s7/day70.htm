        <h2>Joyful Christmas / Glorious New Year 2025/2026</h2>

        <p><strong>To Our Dear Friends,</strong></p>

        <p>What a fascinating and fast-moving year it has been for us.</p>

        <p>Something happened to Anton just two days before Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA was assassinated on 10th September 2025 in Orem, Utah, USA. The dates are significant here: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th September 2025.</p>

        <p>It was on 9th September 2025 that God the Father prepared Anton to receive the tragic news. It all happened on a London bus (route 197) travelling from Penge, London, to Croydon, Surrey. For further incredible details please view the video. </p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JndXIOwZSy8?start=31" title="Prayer Breakthrough - Charlie Kirk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>I received a prophetic word for 2026 on that very bus.</p>

        <p>This brought forward my first YouTube video, which was relayed from our own miraculous chapel (now my studio).</p>

        <p>Our Lord astounded me when the video, once published for the world to see, received more than 900 views in a single day.</p>

        <p>It was a serious and urgent word that I had to pray over with all fervour and zeal.</p>

        <div class="scripture-reference">
            <b>The scripture that came to my attention to confirm the word was found in Luke 24:30–32:</b><br><br>
            <span class="highlight">
                30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.<br>
                31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him, and he disappeared from their sight.<br>
                32 They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
            </span>
        </div>

        <p>So, in the year 2026, I pray that He will open our eyes in an extraordinary way, so much so that our hearts will burn within us and the Scriptures will be embedded in us.</p>

        <p>As I speak the living Word, the scriptural verses will manifest in power and strength.</p>

        <p>What does this mean? Please check it out through these short reel videos, published for the first time in 2025, on the link below:<br>
        <a href="https://shorturl.at/AK7IM">https://shorturl.at/AK7IM</a><br>
        These short videos explain the above statement clearly.</p>

        <p>They came about when our dear Lord opened my eyes and mind to see Jesus Christ as He truly is.</p>

        <p>We are living in very troubling and distressing times. We have been called to pray for the United Kingdom.<br>
        <a href="https://youtube.com/@antonnicholas?si=XXFdn5w-z7a53xoN">https://youtube.com/@antonnicholas</a></p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6yE3DgQxbI?start=14" title="Call to Prayer for the UK" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>The call to prayer is coming from many quarters.<br>
        We are responding. I have been preparing for this call for many years.</p>

        <p>So we lift up a prayer for you all in the year 2026—a year of painful, tumultuous shakings. As far as possible, stay secured in “Goshen territory”—meaning, stay close to our Lord, as Anton does in his room through the early hours of the night, receiving assurances that his family and friends are safe and sound before he finally goes to bed.</p>

        <p><strong>Many, many blessings,</strong></p>

        <p>Anton & Saida Nicholas and Valerie Meilton<br>xxx</p>

        <h2>Flag Counter</h2>
        <p>The counter below was introduced for the first time on <span class="highlight"><i><b>8th January 2014.</b></i></span> Sadly the firm who installed my previous beautiful counter many years ago, and filled it with exciting statistics, suddenly went out of business. As a result we lost all our treasured statistics.<br><br>
        We like national flags portraying on our website so we are re-introducing the flag counter freshly again through another firm. It is so exciting to see visitors coming from the far corners of the earth! <i><b>Commencing 8th January 2014</i></b>.</p>

        <p><b>This Christian hymn, Lead Kindly Light</b> was also a favourite of <b>Mahatma (Mohandas Karamchand) Gandhi</b> and was routinely sung at his prayer meetings.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;Do check this out. Anton had a mesmerising fascination with a particular graveyard, albeit a very pricy distraction.<br>

        ‘The graveyard draws the living still, But never anymore the dead.’<br>Words from the poet Robert Frost.</p>

        <p><b>The Year 2011</b><br><br>
        "On 28th August 2010, at 9-59 am, to be precise, there was a miraculous sign in the skies when a flock of geese gave a majestic, finely drilled and disciplined fly-past. Similar to an air show. An extra-ordinary prelude.<br><br>
        A large portion of the gathered audience of <b>300,000 to 500,000 people</b> witnessed this unusual performance at the Lincoln Memorial, located at the National Mall, Washington DC, on a warm sunny day. The service then commenced at 10 am.<br>
        <b>This is the largest number of people ever assembled by a private individual in the history of the National Mall.</b><br><br>

        <p>We need to plant here without any optional caveats the challenging words of A. W. Tozer, “It is doubtful that God can use anyone greatly until He has hurt him deeply".<br><br>
        So <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/book/chapter1.htm"><b>read</b></a> what the Nicholas family had to persevere through. It will make a fascinating read.</p>

        <p><b>For over 13 years,</b> her Dad (our family’s picture is at the bottom of this page) faithfully prayed and spoke the Word of our Lord aloud (the verses of the bible) every day, together with our daughter Jannine.<br><br>
        Before Jannine left for Cambridge one of the Books of the Bible she read aloud daily with me was the book of Proverbs, a book full of wisdom. We must have covered the book at least 60 times.</p>

        <p><b>Surely Our Lord knew it from the very Beginning, for His Name implies it.</b><br><br>
        He knew that when He first ingrained the burden in me to pray for this church (All Saints Church, Peckham) in 1986, I uttered my prayer from the outside of the church, He had it all planned that one day I was going to get up before dawn to go and intercede inside the church!!! He once declared that HE IS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA.<br><br>
        Habakkuk 2<br>
        1) I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint.<br><br>
        The LORD’s Answer<br>
        2) Then the LORD replied: "Write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald may run with it.<br>
        3) For the revelation waits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.</p>

        <p>On 18th July 2010 as a family we attended the morning service at St. Mary Magdalene with St. Martin’s church, Addiscombe on Canning Road.<br>
        <b>We heard the newly instituted and inducted Vicar, the Reverend Amanda Johnson presenting her first sermon. The scripture she chose for her introductory sharing was Psalm 23 – THE LORD IS (indeed) MY SHEPHERD.</b><br><br>
        Our connection to this church is due to the fact that a close member of our family is a faithful attendee and who is very involved with the worship. This compels us to pray.<br><br>
        Amanda you will be remembered in our prayers. May a revival blossom.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/profiles/grad_val.jpg" alt="Paul's graduation ceremony" style="width:100%;max-width:240px;border-radius:10px;"><br><br>
        Paul graduated with an Honours Degree in his Mathematics tripos from Christ's College, University of Cambridge, 1st July 2005.<br>
        Paul is pictured with his parents, his sister Jannine and our adopted family member Valerie who is positioned on the extreme left.<br><br>
        Our fresh breaking news in 2009 is that Paul will be receiving his MA from Cambridge, March 2009, and his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.<br>
        His graduation ceremony, for his MSc, will take place in the Royal Albert Hall in May 2009.<br>
        On 17th July 2009 Paul conveyed the thrilling news to us that he had passed his final Actuarial Paper.<br>
        Today 24th July 2009 his name was published in the London Times, page 68 stating he is now a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.<br>
        Well done Paul! You can relax now and enjoy your profession as a fully qualified Actuary.<br><br>
        The further breaking news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009.<br>
        One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations.<br>
        A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore).<br>
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a>, she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.<br><br>
        <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/book/chapter1.htm"><b>Do browse through and read</b></a> what delivered Valerie Meilton of all her painful nasty lumps. For when she joined our family she was in harrowing despair.<br><br>
        On Friday, 16th January 1999, we were in Valerie’s house in Claygate, Surrey. At 11-15 pm we were about to leave for London, we went to say goodnight to Valerie’s Mum Vera Meilton.<br>
        It was during this momentous moment she looked directly at us and told us in a rather sweet indirect fashion, “please take care of my only daughter”.<br>
        The final words she uttered to us were “All you need is Jesus.”<br>
        We then prayed and anointed Vera with Holy oil and dedicated her to the sweet Presence of Jesus.<br>
        6 days later she died peacefully at Kingston General Hospital, with Valerie holding her hands.</p>
