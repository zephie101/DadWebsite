<br> <b>We prayerfully did watch live the innaguration of Mr Joseph Robinette Biden Jr as he recited the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at 11:49 a.m, Wednesday 20th January 2021. This was 11 minutes before the constitutionally prescribed noon hour.<br> <br> 
We continue to stand with what is written below. No prophetic words already written will be withdrawn. We patiently await for what God the Father has planned next.<br> <br> One very important revelation we have learnt is that the timeline for God the Father is completely different from our understanding and frame of mind. <br> <br> Nothing absolutely nothing will be deleted or omitted from the Words of our Lord spoken to us over the last few weeks before the innaguration.<br> <br> We truly believe what has been written on this Prophetic Page will come to pass in due season.

<br> <br> Written on Thursday 21st January 2021. 9-14 pm.    </b><br> <br>

<b>Within the above context I feel led to insert this powerful prayer today Monday 18th January 2021. Provided by Dutch Sheets Ministries. </b> <br> <br> Thank you Jesus that more than 200,000 individuals will be imploring this prayer all over the world. I genuinely believe this is a very strategic prayer that will invade the Heavenly atmosphere. Please do join us and pray this prayer loudly.<br> <br>

So Lord God Almighty, the Lord of the Armies of Heaven, I thank you for the Power of the Blood of Yeshua, Jesus, over all witchcraft and occult.<br> <br>

We come before You now covered by the Blood of Jesus Christ and proclaim over the worldwide systems of evil seeking to take control in America and in the nations.<br> <br>

Let the occult shields of protection be taken away from everyone involved in theft, fraud, and corruption.<br> <br>

May their occult shields of protection no longer be able to hide them from being exposed by the light.<br> <br>

Let witchcraft manipulation be brought to an end in and over the Congress, Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court, the FBI, the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Pentagon and over the state executives, courts and legislatures, and over election integrity.<br> <br>

As Joshua and Caleb proclaimed to the Hebrews intimidated by the giants, we say to all who are intimidated by today’s giants,<br> <br>
‘...do not rebel against the Lord. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them...their protection is gone...their protection is gone...their protection is gone...but the Lord is with us...Do not be afraid of them.’ (Numbers 14:9)<br> <br>
“We proclaim this in the mighty Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Amen.” <br> <br>
 
<p class="main">
So it is not the Supreme Court, nor Congress or the work of any man or woman but solely the Holy Ghost who is going to triumph in the life of President Donald J Trump. Thank you Jesus.<br><br>

Zechariah 4 v6: "So he answered me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: 'Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of Armies."<br> <br>

<b> 25th December 2020:</b> The onslaught has commenced. President Trump's enemies strengthened by demonic power will begin to have their downfall now. When we celebrate the birthday of Jesus one by one of his enemies will collapse under the glorious power of the Living God.<br> <br>

Keep a lookout on how they fall.  <br> </span></a> </h2>

Prophetic Word for 2018:</b> Boasting About Tomorrow. <br>

13) Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.” 14) Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. 15) Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.” 16) As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. </p>

The other members who are facing trial are Serina Wee Gek Yin, Chew Eng Han, Sharon Tan, Tan Ye Peng and John Lam.<br> <br>It was relieving to note that Singapore's Commissioner of Charities has lifted the suspension order on Pastor Kong Hee’s wife, Sun Ho. This will allow her to resume her executive duties at the church.<br> <br> We will definitely pray for Pastor Kong Hee and his family.<br> <br> The silver lining here is that this trial has triggered an overflow of prayer and intercession worldwide. This will indeed precipitate the prayer below leading to an outpouring of Holy Ghost power on Singapore.

To us it sounded like a chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. The news stated there is rapid growth within the Christian churches. This was mentioned on BBC Radio 4 at 8-10am on 13th October 2013. This spontaneous growth is most specifically amongst the Pentecostal Churches.Apparently in the past 14 years congregations within the Pentecostal Churches have more than doubled in London and grown by a quarter in the rest of England. The evidence comes from a research group called Future First who studied attendance at 10,000 churches since 1998. Robert Piggott, the BBC Religious Affairs Correspondent,put his own spin on for this explosive growth. Apparently to him it is to do with an expressive style of worship and focus on healing. The researchers cite immigration and the exuberant style for this growth amongst the black majority churches. The BBC and the research team sadly have not heard of the Holy Spirit.<br> <br> We as believers know that it is through praying, fasting, interceding, groaning and supplication that God the Holy Spirit is imparting an outpouring evidenced through signs and wonders.<br> <br> Many of us need to wake up with a joyful anticipation before dawn to pray and proclaim for a Holy Spirit Revival on all nations.
