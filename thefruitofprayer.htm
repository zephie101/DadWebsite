		                                  <h1>Prophetic Word 2025/ 2026.

		 These particular prophetic words are being shouted and declared from the Roof Tops, like an echo: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.<br> It was actually in the year 2021 when I first spontaneously shouted these words aloud. Monday 6th September 2021 at 3-50 am, is when I made mention to God the Holy Spirit that I have had enough of the manoeuvring of the devil and his demonic activities on my friends and family members.<br> <br> Suddenly from no where so many authentic Prophets in 2025 are declaring that 'Enough is Enough'. For it has taken 4 years of intense prayer &amp; intercession for these words to come to pass.<br> <br> These will be the years, (2025/2026) when the general populace will be introduced to the magnificient and awesome power of God the Holy Spirit.<br>  It is Acts 19 verses 1 -2: It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the Inland districts and came to Ephesus. He found a few disciples there and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They answered him, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." <br > <br> Oh, I have been reading with fear and trembling the powerful words of A.W.Tozer, who passed on in the year 1963. He wrote, 'This is why it is so vastly important that we should know the Holy Spirit. More than once, I have gotten on my knees and apologised to the Holy Spirit for the way the Church has treated Him. We have treated Him shoddily.<br> We have treated Him in such a manner that if you were to treat a guest that way, the guest would go away grief-stricken and never return.'<br> <br> Come, O Holy Sprit, fill the hearts of Your faithful, and enkindle in them the fire of your Love. Send forth your Spirit and they shall be created. And You shall renew the face of the earth.<br> Let us pray.O God, who taught the heart of the faithful by the light of the Holy Spirit, grant that by the gift of the same Spirit we may be always truly wise and ever rejoice in His consolation.<br> <br> Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.<br> <br>
		 Psalm 23 Verse 1: The Lord is My Shepherd; I shall not want.<br> Psalm 91 ( Hebraic Version)" You who live in the shelter of Elyon ( Most High),who spends your nights in the shadow of Shaddai(Breasted One)". With a firm instruction from Our Lord on Monday 9th August 2021 Anton commenced and still continues his meditative whole nights of Prayer. Just to touch the Throne Room. Goshen territory. A very safe and secured haven.</h1> 
		 
		 <br> <br> <br> <h3>Prophetic Word 2024: Prayerfully prepare. Distressing, intense 'shaking' has commenced and is progressing speedily. I have heard His Word and responded spontaneously. Read details below, including our Prayer Chapel built with miraculous provision.<br><br>Updated 24th April 2024. Pray specifically for London, UK, where dark forces gather malignantly at a tremendous rate. My heart is burdened to pray aggressively to scale down the soon-coming shaking on London. The Household Cavalry horses incident on 24th April 2024 is a precursor to this forthcoming shaking.</h3>

						The following friendships shaped and boosted our early Christian life. Alan Meyer, the late Pippa Meyer, Danny John Mc'Gill, Gerry Kearney {originally from Ireland}, Steve Burton, Jonathan Gwilt and Joseph Niles (originally hailing from Brickfields Kuala Lumpur).<br> <br> It was in his prestigious home in Brickfields that my visionary grandfather B P Nicholas conceived the idea of forming one the first original Malaysian Banks, The Oriental Bank of Malaya Ltd.<br><br> The other individual who helped us spiritually was Anthea Dimitri - Fotiou. We were also acquainted with her late husband Marco Dimitri, who was a very good friend of mine. They had a daughter named Rebecca.

						Saida's foundation was etched out after leaving home, when she joined a Christian Community located at Crewdson Road, Oval, London SW9.<br> <br>  She stayed with a group of believers commencing May 1977.
