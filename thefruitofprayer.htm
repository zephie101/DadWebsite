		                                  <h1>Prophetic Word 2025/ 2026.

		 These particular prophetic words are being shouted and declared from the Roof Tops, like an echo: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.<br> It was actually in the year 2021 when I first spontaneously shouted these words aloud. Monday 6th September 2021 at 3-50 am, is when I made mention to God the Holy Spirit that I have had enough of the manoeuvring of the devil and his demonic activities on my friends and family members.<br> <br> Suddenly from no where so many authentic Prophets in 2025 are declaring that 'Enough is Enough'. For it has taken 4 years of intense prayer & intercession for these words to come to pass.<br> <br> These will be the years, (2025/2026) when the general populace will be introduced to the magnificient and awesome power of God the Holy Spirit.<br>  It is Acts 19 verses 1 -2: It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the Inland districts and came to Ephesus. He found a few disciples there and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They answered him, “No, we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” <br > <br> Oh, I have been reading with fear and trembling the powerful words of A.W.Tozer, who passed on in the year 1963. He wrote, 'This is why it is so vastly important that we should know the Holy Spirit. More than once, I have gotten on my knees and apologised to the Holy Spirit for the way the Church has treated Him. We have treated Him shoddily.<br> We have treated Him in such a manner that if you were to treat a guest that way, the guest would go away grief-stricken and never return.'<br> <br> Come, O Holy Sprit, fill the hearts of Your faithful, and enkindle in them the fire of your Love. Send forth your Spirit and they shall be created. And You shall renew the face of the earth.<br> Let us pray.O God, who taught the heart of the faithful by the light of the Holy Spirit, grant that by the gift of the same Spirit we may be always truly wise and ever rejoice in His consolation.<br> <br> Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.<br> <br>
		 Psalm 23 Verse 1: The Lord is My Shepherd; I shall not want.<br> Psalm 91 ( Hebraic Version)" You who live in the shelter of Elyon ( Most High),who spends your nights in the shadow of Shaddai(Breasted One)". With a firm instruction from Our Lord on Monday 9th August 2021 Anton commenced and still continues his meditative whole nights of Prayer. Just to touch the Throne Room. Goshen territory. A very safe and secured haven.</h1> 
		 
		 </h1>
		 
		 <br> <br> <br> <h3>Prophetic Word 2024: Prayerfully prepare. Distressing, intense 'shaking' has commenced and is progressing speedily. I have heard His Word and responded spontaneously. Read details below, including our Prayer Chapel built with miraculous provision.<br><br>Updated 24th April 2024. Pray specifically for London, UK, where dark forces gather malignantly at a tremendous rate. My heart is burdened to pray aggressively to scale down the soon-coming shaking on London. The Household Cavalry horses incident on 24th April 2024 is a precursor to this forthcoming shaking.</h3>

It was at this College that Paul & Jannine Nicholas were awarded top Academic Scholarships after passing the entrance exams with distinctions. During their time there, the appointed Headmasters were Mr. B. D. Dance (-July 1993), Mr. J. D. Moore (1993-July 1997), Mr. D. I. Davies (September 1997-2004), and Mrs. Fiona Cordeaux (September 2004-2006). Mrs. Cordeaux was once Deputy Head of Wimbledon High School. Interestingly, Dr. Anthony F. Seldon was Deputy Headmaster there whilst Paul studied, later becoming the 13th Master of Wellington College. <b>23rd May 2014: We pray for Mrs. Joanna Seldon, committing her into the comforting arms of our Lord.</b></p>

We were also acquainted with her late husband Marco Dimitri, who was a very good friend of mine. They had a daughter named Rebecca.
						
						<br> <br> 
						Saida's foundation was etched out after leaving home, when she joined a Christian Community located at Crewdson Road, Oval, London SW9.<br> <br>  She stayed with a group of believers commencing May 1977. It was led by Spencer and Helen Scrutton who now reside in Australia. Others in the Community included Reverend Dr. Robert Ward.<br><br>

                    <p><img src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/main/DavidLamb24.jpeg" alt="David Lamb, Saida, Joyce Lamb"> Saida evangelized with David and Joyce Lamb at St. Mark’s Church, Kennington, yet her name was totally omitted from a book referencing the church. The photo above shows Saida standing alongside David Lamb and Joyce Lamb at the back. This photo was taken on a holiday in Switzerland.<br> <br> She sacrificed her nursing career, qualifying as a Registered Nurse from King’s College Hospital (October 1977) and as a Registered Sick Children’s Nurse at Great Ormond Street (July 1980).<br> <br> She worked at Belgrave Children’s Hospital until April 1981, surrendering her career in May 1981 for full-time evangelism. The Nursing Administration offered her a Ward Sister’s post, which she declined.<br> <br> Saida's earliest foundation was etched out after leaving home, when she joined a Christian Community located at Crewdson Road, Oval, London SW9.<br> <br>  
						Saida originally stayed with a group of believers commencing May 1977. It was led by Spencer and Helen Scrutton. They arrived at St. Marks after being involved with a thriving Christian Community in Indonesia.<br><br> Among others who stayed in the Community House included Russell Ewens, Nick Jewitt, Maxine Bartlett and Reverend Dr. Robert Ward now residing in Newcastle.<br> <br> Dr. Robert Ward led a very active Church, St. Lukes Newcastle. He is married to Reverend Alice Ward.<br> <br> It was at this Community House at Crewdson Road that the friendship between Saida and Anton commenced on Saturday 7th November 1981. It was through a party organised by the leaders. <br> <br> The conversation between us started well but tension arose when we realised that Saida was an on fire Evangelical Christian and Anton was a true blue, truly grounded Orthodox Roman Catholic.

                    <p><img src="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/images/daily/mumbday.jpg" alt="Saida’s birthday"> At a top North London Grammar School, Saida, the only Asian girl, faced rejection from Caucasian boys during exams, sitting next to her reluctantly. This, compounded by her father’s death at 16 months and a solo flight from Uganda at 13, left deep wounds. Her agonizing experiences were never ministered to adequately, with prophetic words often superficial. <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/book/chapter1.htm">Read her deliverance story</a>.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/daily/s4/day38.htm">Saida celebrating a very special birthday</a>. She became a committed Christian at 16 on Easter Sunday, the only family member to do so, lacking familial spiritual guidance. Now, she’s confident in Christ Jesus’ presence.</p>

            <h2>Prophetic Word for 2024</h2>
            <p>Both physical & spiritual kingdom wars will rage, intensifying attacks on Christian marriages. Saida’s past associations impaired her walk with Jesus (Romans 1:25, Luke 14:11). We proclaim freedom from these, moving into ‘Goshen territory’ with prayer and scripture. The 2024 Prophetic Word urges us to move speedily into a safe spiritual arena. I commenced my daily night vigil on 9th August 2021, feeling comforted by His Presence every night.</p>
            <p>We soundproofed the Chapel to proclaim names of those who hindered Saida, rocketing prayers to Heaven’s Court Room (Psalm 55:12-13). <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXFgl9FzJPs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
            <h3>Prayer Vigil</h3>
            <p>On 18th Sept 2010, 80,000 sang “Lead Kindly Light” at Hyde Park. <iframe width="500" height="330" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3j2hBSgZMrw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> Over 181,000 viewers have experienced its comfort.</p>
            <h3>Protection of the Lord</h3>
            <p>We pray Psalm 91 and Ephesians 6:10-20 daily, trusting Joel 2:24-26 for restoration as Saida resumes nursing in paediatric and neonatal care. Job opportunities are opening up, fulfilling her years of experience.</p>
            <h3>Global Context</h3>
            <p>12th October 2023: Amir Tsarfati reports Israelis of all walks asking for prayers amid war. Lance Wallnau echoes this, with family in Israel pleading for prayer. Yoel Ben David of Jews for Jesus notes Russian Jews requesting Bibles during this Middle East conflict.</p>
