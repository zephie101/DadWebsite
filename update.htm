                    <p>I first met Annette Nicholas (maiden name: Annette Thushiyanthi Ponnuthurai) beside the grave of her father-in-law Uncle Cyril Nicholas in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia April 2017.</p>
                    <p>So I asked her how her relationship with Jesus Christ was going. She told me that it was going strong and apparently she had just been connected to a Charismatic Christian group. So I said, “I am so pleased to hear that.”</p>
                    <p>The final sentence she told me was that she was faithfully reading the Bible.</p>
                    <p>Sadly I never had a chance to meet her again.</p>
                    <p>Thanks Be To God. I must say that she had a very gentle and quiet spirit.</p>

                    <p>On 7th of July 2002 we received a phone call that my dear brother Justin Nicholas had fallen unconscious in his home near his bedside. This was in Gloucester, which is on the western side of England, approximately 120 miles from London.</p>
                    <p>Our family members from Malaysia and Canada were informed that the situation was very critical and some flew here at short notice from these countries.</p>
                    <p>Our own family rushed from London to Gloucester and arrived there at 1am.</p>
                    <p>My sister and her husband also came in from London and arrived on and around the same time too.</p>
                    <p>The medical staff were informed not to disconnect the life support system until we had arrived there. At 2am the Doctors told us personally that his prognosis was very poor. CT scans showed that he had had a massive brain haemorrhage (they were unaware of the extent of brain damage) and that it was a waste of time to send him to the specialist Frenchay Hospital in Bristol for brain surgery. After receiving the dismal doctors' report, we went into his room in the Intensive Care ward and then it suddenly hit us that my brother was dying. There was a Filipino nurse there who left us to be with him on our own.</p>
                    <p>A sad thought possessed us which took a long time to shake off - that my brother Justin during the small hours of the morning could have died with no family members present to hold his hands while he was dying. As a comfort and to speak words from the bible reassuring him constantly that he was not alone and that Jesus, our Redeemer and Saviour was present. Compassion and mercy demands that you console the loved one who is dying. It's comfort through association.</p>
                    <p>Just at this moment there is a prompting from Our Lord to place this on record of an earlier incident. We need to say a mighty thank you to our close friend Valerie Meilton. For on 15th October 2001, after receiving the urgent news from us about my brother Justin, just landing from Malaysia had fallen unconscious at Terminal 3 in Heathrow Airport. He was rushed by ambulance to the nearest hospital.</p>
                    <p>She dropped all her plans at a moment's notice. She rushed by Taxi from Cippenham near Windsor to Hillingdon Hospital, in Uxbridge, Middlesex to assist and support Justin in the Accident & Emergency Department. She stayed all night from 12 midnight till 8-30 am. Once he was stable, she graciously proceeded on to her work place at a Hospice near Ealing, London.

                    <p><b>At the Intensive Care Ward in Gloucester we decided to engage in intense & vibrant spiritual warfare. We declared to Justin the Lord's report, armed with the weapons of warfare, overflowing prayer and the Word of our testimony; that Jesus Christ is the only Deliverer and Healer.</b></p>
                    <p><b>We spoke aloud about the healing effects of the Precious Blood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. With conviction we decided to combat the enemy forces. We challenged the angel of death in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, proclaimed the Lordship of Jesus over his life and we anointed him with oil. We saw life coming back to him the next day. We witnessed a Living God manifesting His Presence by showing forth a miracle on my brother Justin. Glory be to God!</b></p>
                    <p>We also have been informed that loads of people prayed for Justin including his Pastor, church members, relatives and friends from Youth With A Mission. Various people had distinct prophecies, verses from scripture, positive pictures, prayed in the Holy Spirit, words of knowledge, encouragement and comfort that Justin will be healed and delivered from the death bed, some even fasted and prayed. To all these people we say, Thank You.</p>

                    <p>Capture what happened when our Lord Jesus appeared to Anton in a 3 dimensional Prophetic vision at a Prayer Centre near the Pyrénées mountains in France, July 1979. It was a Divine instruction that had to be fulfilled and obeyed to the last dot. Every scene in the vision came to pass and was fulfilled on 23rd April 1983.

            <p>Paul attained his MSc from Imperial College, London. He was also awarded a distinction (a first) for his MSc.</p>
            <p>The further exciting news is that our daughter Jannine has been given a conditional offer at St. John's College, Cambridge, to read for a BA Honours degree in Law commencing October 2009. One of the reasons she opted for this College was to follow in the footsteps of her grand Uncle <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/benedict.htm"><b>Benedict Ponniah</b></a>, who was rightly positioned to become the Secretary General of the United Nations. A Queens Scholar, in the same prime league as the renowned Seniors Mr & Mrs Lee Kuan Yew (the first Prime Minister of modern Singapore). <a href="https://www.antonnicholas.org.uk/profiles/jannine.htm"><b>The conditions are steep for Jannine</b></a> she needs to get a minimum mark of 90% for her A level subjects.</p>
